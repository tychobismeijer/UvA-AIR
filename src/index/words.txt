YOU hardly expect a house with an address like 69 Main Street to have all the seclusion of a country mansion, but Kirkland in Killearn, to the west of the Campsie Fells, is set well back from the main road in mature lawned and wooded gardens of around three acres, writes Eileen Crone. The house, built in the Thirties for a local worthy, Colonel Innes, has been converted into four homes, one of which is for sale. This property has a ground floor reception hall and accommodation on the first and upper floors, including a lounge with dining area and front and rear bay windows, a sitting room, breakfast kitchen and two double bedrooms. The house also has loft storage space, and an integral garage. Slater Hogg &amp; Howison invite offers over #105,000.

Detectives investigating a series of fires at Perth nightclubs have arrested an 18-year-old youth. A report will be sent to the procurator-fiscal and the man is expected to appear today at Perth Sheriff Court. Officers also went to several homes in Perth early on Monday, and a number of people are helping with their inquiries in Edinburgh. Tayside officers also acted with Lothian and Borders Police in a similar operation in connection with the same investigation.

COMPARISONS between football north and south of the Border, considering the respective resources, may not be fair, but the contrast has never been more vividly illustrated than by two major transfers involving strikers yesterday. At the same time as Manchester United were raiding their bank balance to produce a #7m package to buy Andy Cole of Newcastle, Celtic introduced their own new striker, Pierre van Hooydonk, who cost them #1.2m. Celtic manager Tommy Burns was not slow to point out the difference and he is right when he says that the English market has gone to heights beyond the reach of most clubs in this country. Even Rangers, who have been leaders in the British market at times, would probably baulk at going to the #7m level for a single player. That price includes the #1m-rated Northern Irish winger Keith Gillespie, who joins Newcastle, but, even at #6m cash, the transfer is #2m more than Rangers' record output for Duncan Ferguson from Dundee United. ''If you look at what Cole is costing, I believe a player like Pierre in England would cost #2m to #3m. That is why I think we have got value for money,'' said Burns. His view that Celtic had to look outside England seems all the more reasonable when it is remembered that the most exciting player in Scotland this season, Rangers' Danish forward Brian Laudrup, was a snip at #2.3m. But Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson had no qualms about paying the British record fee for Cole. ''He is our type of player,'' he said. ''I have been saying that for 18 months but never thought I would get a sniff of signing him. This was a last-gasp effort.'' There was nothing last-gasp about Burns' capture of van Hooydonk. The Celtic manager has has his man well assessed over the past three months and is convinced that he is the right man for the job. Celtic supporters will prefer to hear about the Dutchman, however, and the new man conducted his first appearance at the stadium with aplomb and, as is ever the case with folk from the Netherlands, a decent command of English. Asked why he has not had his desire for a move to a big club before now, Pierre said: ''I think it is because my main talent is for scoring goals, rather than being extra special on the ground or in the air.'' If that, indeed, is his forte, he can expect to be appreciated by the fans of a team who seem to have lost their way in that direction. But the word from Holland is that the 6ft 5in striker from Breda can play the game all right. ''He is something we have looked far and wide for,'' said Burns, ''and I am sure he will give us options we did not have before.'' Burns or his cohorts watched the Dutchman four or five times after having studied videos of him with Breda and the final view of him in the 2-2 draw with Ajax in mid-December convinced the manager to back their judgment. ''We had made up our minds that we needed this kind of player because we have so many small men in the side. It limits your options. We didn't think that Breda played to his strengths. He is very aggressive and will give us a bit of stature that has been lacking. ''But he is not here as saviour of Celtic FC. There will need to be another two or three good players to come in yet.'' Pierre expects to be nervous before the game tonight. However, once the whistle blows, he does not reckon he will have any problems. ''I have no worries about the Scottish game. I have the body to cope. I hope playing for a big club will help my international ambitions, but wherever you play, you have to do it well.'' Managing director Fergus McCann said that the money being spent on the new man was part of the funding already in place from the share issue that has been announced. ''More than half the funding has come in and we are hopeful that it could be funded in excess of #7m. But this is a building process and Tommy will have ideas on two or three more players he wishes to bring in to the team.'' Burns, who also signed young Sligo Rovers defender Declan Boyle for a modest #30,000, has problems for the meeting with Hearts tonight at Hampden. ''There is a virus hitting the players and we will have to wait and see how they are tomorrow. Brian O'Neil, Tony Mowbray, and Mike Galloway have it, and Peter Grant is just recovering, so we will need to check out the others before we can make any team decision. But Hooydonk will play.'' Six years on from that historic and dramatic day when Maurice Johnston switched from Rangers instead of signing for Celtic, Mo's days as a top-team player at Tynecastle had seemed well and truly over. He was demoted in mid-September, relegated to the reserves, and occasionally left to train with the club's youngsters. The relationship between him and the club appeared even more strained when the chairman, Chris Robinson, announced last week that Johnston could leave at any time on a free transfer. ''But we will not pay the remainder of his contract, worth just under about #200,000,'' added Robinson, who also refused to discuss the situation with Johnston's agent, Bill McMurdo. Under the new FIFA regulations, he is not permitted to talk about transfers with any agent who is not licensed with the world authority. There seemed little cheering news about for the former Partick Thistle, Watford, Celtic, Nantes, Rangers, and Scotland striker, despite his reputed #3000-a-week salary with the Edinburgh club, but his inherent ability to put the ball in the net has come to his rescue, not for the first time in his career. Hearts manager Tommy McLean saw Johnston score twice for the reserves in the 2-0 derby win over Hibs at Easter Road on Monday and was so impressed that he promoted him to the pool for tongiht's match with Celtic. ''We have a few knocks,'' said McLean, ''so I want to take a big squad. And Maurice is back in my thoughts. That was the best I have seen him play since I came here and, if he continues that way, he'll be back involved. There is no problem with him, or any other player for that matter. If they perform, they'll play -- it is as simple as that.'' Hearts, buoyed by their win over Motherwell on Sunday, would catch up with Celtic in the division if they were to repeat that victory tonight and McLean has taken much encouragement from the way his team played at Fir Park. ''Brian Hamilton will get confidence from that early goal and I was pleased with his showing. We needed strong running on either side of Jim Bett, and he and Scott Leitch provided that.'' McLean has also done his homework on Celtic's new man. His Dutch contacts have fed him plenty of information about the Breda striker. ''We know he is tall and good in the air but I am also told that, for a big man, he is good on the ground. It sounds like a fair combination to me.'' * Ferguson takes spending up to #32m -- Page 31

THE Scottish Football Association have launched an investigation into a coin-throwing incident at the Partick Thistle-Rangers match. Partick midfielder Chic Charnley was the target of a coin thrown from the crowd at Firhill on Saturday. Referee Les Mottram has included the matter in his report to the SFA on the premier division game. Now, the authorities are to write to both clubs for their views on the matter. A SFA spokesman said: ''We will recieve their comments and then the matter will go before the disciplinary committee.'' * RANGERS' Brian Laudrup helped Denmark into the final of the Inter-Continental Cup in Riyadh with a 4-2 penalty shoot-out victory over Mexico after the teams had drawn 1-1 over 90 minutes.

KEVIN Keegan, the Newcastle manager, clashed with angry supporters over his decision to sell top striker Andy Cole. Keegan confronted the fans after they gathered outside St James's Park in pouring rain, looking shocked at the news. But their demands to know what was going on and why the fans' favourite was suddenly leaving received a sharp response of: ''I'm in charge -- not you.'' The supporters trooped to the main reception area of the stadium's Jackie Milburn stand. When they spotted Keegan and his deputy, Terry McDermott, just about to enter the manager's office, they began chanting ''Talk to us Keegan'' and ''Come out here.'' The managerial duo walked down the entrance steps to meet the group and were bombarded with questions about the club's plans. The exchange became heated and tempers frayed but as some fans condemned the decision to sell Cole, Keegan snapped back: ''You're now telling me how to manage my team. Don't do that. I felt we should take it on. And you have got to allow me to do that. If it doesn't work out, I know what the implications are. ''Tough decisions have got to be made and if you are scared of making them, you shouldn't be in this job.'' Fans jammed the club switchboard and flooded local radio stations with calls protesting at the record-breaking #7m deal. David Craggs, chairman of Newcastle's 800-strong London supporters club, summed up the mood of his fellow fans. ''I'm dumbfounded that Cole is going,'' he said. ''I know many people who follow Newcastle are. We are all in a state of shock. It hasn't sunk in yet that Andy Cole has played his last game for the club. ''What we need now is a quality replacement for Cole, someone like Stan Collymore.'' Keegan has taken the biggest gamble of his short managerial life in selling Cole. But the former England player insists: ''The deal was too good to turn down.'' The #6m in cash will be used to launch the next stage of Keegan's team-building, and, in Keith Gillespie, he believes he has captured a player who could become the best of his generation. ''He's possibly the best youngster I've seen for a long time,'' said Keegan, whose inquiry for the Northern Ireland winger sparked United's counter-bid for Cole. ''I have been thinking that for the good of the future of this club I might need to change things around, and this was an opportunity to do it. I accept that we're losing a great player. But the lad we're getting could be anything, I believe that, and we're getting the money to do things with.'' But Keegan knows that many on Tyneside will not forgive him for selling their hero. ''I am hopeful about signing someone else, but I am not going to promise that someone's going to come in and score the same number of goals as Andy Cole, because his record is phenomenal.''

Austin Lafferty argues that allowing TV cameras into courts will not, alone, improve access to the law THE BBC series, The Trial was the first time cameras have recorded a criminal trial in Scotland and, in my opinion, provided a well-made insight into criminal law in action. Its producer, Nick Catliff, is to be admired, for breathing life into what is, in truth, a stultifyingly unspectacular process. The series had to be made. It was an experiment waiting to happen, ever since the Lord President, Lord Hope, let it be known that he was in favour of opening up the machinery of justice to the cameras. In this he has been decades ahead of many others in the legal world, but among those lagging behind are a large swathe of his own Faculty of Advocates. Mr Donald Findlay, QC, -- the subject of some of the early filming work -- has come out against the idea of televising the criminal courts, but he at least has come to a considered opinion having seen and taken part in the process. However, I have been disappointed to read and hear criticisms levelled by other interested parties, not all of whom have ever seen the actual process. They have described the televising of the courts as shallow, overly dramatic, and cheapening to the law. There has also been a steady tide, if only a gently lapping one, of approval, notably from solicitors, but as yet no bandwagon. Faint praise has not damned the idea of televising the courts on a regular basis, but the relatively lukewarm reaction of the legal world to various recent programmes has probably given producers and commissioning editors considerable pause. I suspect that the media's needs, to entertain and stimulate more than to educate, will lead to the selection of trials and cases which media people call ''sexy'', ie exciting, lurid, and suspenseful. But that is not what legal life is about. As Nick Catliff almost managed to avoid showing, the daily work of the courts is routine, necessary, and often boring. Yes, there are dramatic trials, but they are few, and generally unrepresentative. I write all this with a note of wistfulness. If I may be personal, I must report that I have, over the past 13 years, had a double life. I have worked as a solicitor and a broadcaster. I have lost count of the number of phone-in advice programmes I have conducted on TV and independent radio. Call lines are jammed, not just because of my good cheekbones or winning manner, but for a much more basic reason than that. People want to know the law. Tush tush, say the traditionalists in the legal profession, that's what we are here for (and anyway, we don't want them to know too much, it might not be good for them, and it sure as hell wouldn't be good for us) and it's too complicated for the ordinary punter to understand, you know. Wrong, wrong, wrong. For a start, the law is not in the main complicated, just a bit tortuous, and that's a different thing. The basic problem is inaccessibility. Somebody recently said to me that a successful lawyer just needs to be a good librarian. A lawyer will either have the answer to a legal problem from his own knowledge or experience, or will know where to find it in reported cases, statutes or textbooks. What's intrinsically difficult about that? But what has made my blood boil over the past 13 years is the overall failure to bring the law and the people it serves (or is it still the people who are subject to it?) closer together. We still have people going to police stations unaware of their right to representation or even to silence. There are wives who still fear their violent and threatening husbands may put out them of the matrimonial home without a penny if they stand up for themselves. There are workers who are unaware of their contractual and legal rights in the workplace. And many of my phone-in viewers and listeners have nowhere else to turn to, and that is a failure of the legal system. And what are solicitors doing about this? Many are advertising first interviews at no charge, some are running adverts on the various media, and the Law Society of Scotland has been involved in a television campaign which is only barely saved by the slogan ''It's Never Too Early To Call Your Solicitor'' and a truly inspired poster campaign that uses the same phrase to effects both thought-provoking and amusing. But that's it. And no-one else is doing anything that I can see. There are bodies such as the Legal Services Agency which runs a professional and focused practice to take care of difficult and sometimes highly technical cases as well as more academic work. There are the law centres, in places like Castlemilk, that are catering for the needs of a local population. And there is the Citizens' Advice Bureau, a first stop for individual citizens seeking advice. But the work being done is overwhelmingly reactive. Only when someone has a problem which threatens their liberty, financial wellbeing or domestic security do they, in a panic, leap on to the legal lifeboat. The universities and colleges have the expertise, but cater mainly for their own students and academic needs. The Faculty of Advocates has a consultative role. Certainly, all bases are loaded. Solicitors, advocates, and academics are all busy professionals, and the public are generally well served by lawyers as agents. But the gaping hole in the social fabric remains. The public do not know the law. That is not the fault of the public, who have no effective say in the development or imposition of new and old laws -- we don't elect judges for fixed terms, but should. Our politicians push through legislation such as the present Criminal Justice Bill without a proper electoral mandate or sufficient time for consultation. The list could go on. It is a disgrace that all schools do not offer a legal studies course and just as bad that the Government has no mechanism for providing a body of useful legal and constitutional information in a convenient format for citizens. As in law so to in health, prevention is better than cure, and cheaper in the long run. As with everything else, governments only react when there is pressure. The Law Society of Scotland as one legitimate pressure group has worked hard to protect its members, and what is good for solicitors is generally good for the public, despite what the public instinctively thinks of lawyers. But the legal profession must, in conjunction with other bodies, stand up for the ordinary citizen in a new and even more fundamental way than ever before. It's not enough to improve the provision of legal services in the same pattern we are used to, or even to protect what is there from cost-cutting and ''rationalisation'' -- the diminution of rights. Over the past 13 years, the changes in the law and the practice of the law have so far done nothing much to enhance citizenship. I'm no John the Baptist, but I still feel like a voice broadcasting in the wilderness.

The work of Scottish composers is to have an unprecedented airing when Radio 3 presents a week of programmes featuring their music. Michael Tumelty reports. IN an unprecedented display of muscle, Scotland's composers are about to receive a flagship display on BBC Radio 3. The week after next, Radio 3's daily Composer of the Week programme will be devoted to a survey of music by twentieth-century Scottish composers. Yes, we have had the unparalleled Scotland's Music, though that was on Radio Scotland only; and yes, many years ago there was a Scottish day on Radio 3. But there has been nothing quite like this before. Over a series of five programmes, 15 major works by 13 composers -- all still living -- will receive complete performances. Every generation (apart from the young Turks, such as Magnus Robb, who features separately on this page) is represented. And almost every genre of contemporary Scottish classical music -- orchestral, opera, chamber, choral, instrumental, and music theatre -- will be explored. The series is one strand of Fairest Isle, Radio 3's year-long celebration of British music and culture, conceived by Radio 3 controller Nicholas Kenyon. The senior generation of Scottish composers, born in the 1920s, is well-represented by those who stayed when the trend was to go elsewhere to make it: Thomas Wilson and Ronald Stevenson. Thea Musgrave and Iain Hamilton -- who went to work in the States -- will also feature in a programme, along with (from a younger generation) James Dillon, whose tough music has always been more appreciated in Europe than on his native turf. From what might be called -- broadly -- the middle generation, there will be music from John Maxwell Geddes, Martin Dalby, William Sweeney, and Judith Weir. And from the cutting edge -- composers still in their thirties -- there will be Sally Beamish, whose career has rocketed since she moved to Scotland, Alasdair Nicolson, who has leaped into prominence in the past two years, and, of course, James MacMillan, who gets a programme to himself. All three Scottish symphony orchestras will be contributing (by recordings) to the series. The Royal SNO with their former principal conductor, the late Bryden Thomson, will be performing Thomas Wilson's Into the Light; the Scottish Chamber Orchestra will round off the week with MacMillan's dazzling music theatre work, Visitatio Sepulchri. The house band, the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, will be playing Edward McGuire's Source, John Maxwell Geddes's stellar overture, Voyager, and William Sweeney's An Rathad Ur, which features saxophonist Tommy Smith and is one of the few genuinely successful fusions of folk, jazz, and symphonic idioms. Other performers involved include the Chamber Group of Scotland, who will play Martin Dalby's Man Walking, Alasdair Nicolson's explosive Punch, and Sally Beamish's Oracle Beach and Gala Water, the Delme Quartet, the City of London Sinfonia, and Boston Musica Viva. Cappella Nova will also feature with Ronald Stevenson's spectacular choral work In Memoriam Robert Carver. ''It is,'' said Simon Lord, producer of the series, ''a mammoth week for Scottish composers. There has never been such a comprehensive series, showing just how many strings they have to their bows.'' And, as he pointed out, the survey is right across the geographical spectrum, embracing composers who have left Scotland and worked in London and abroad, composers who stayed, composers who have returned to their roots (such as MacMillan) and, in the case of Sally Beamish, an English-born composer who moved to Scotland and thrived. But there is more to the Scottish week than just the five hour-long morning programmes. On the Thursday the entire Radio 3 network will be given over to a Glasgow Evening that will begin with the drive-time programme In Tune, music and talk presented by Linda Ormiston and featuring singer Bill McCue, conductor Nicholas McGegan, and violinist Anthony Marwood. Marwood will then appear as soloist in a live broadcast from the City Hall with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra in the world premiere of Sally Beamish's Violin Concerto. The programme will also feature the doyen of Scottish trumpeters John Wallace in Sir Harrison Birtwistle's Endless Parade. Wallace and Beamish will also appear in an interval talk. A further discussion, chaired by former 1990 director and Tramway guru Neil Wallace, on the arts in Glasgow, follows the concert. To round off the Glasgow evening, there is a ceilidh, live from Studio One, with artists as diverse as Seelyhoo, clarsach player Savourna Stevenson, the Yggdrasil String Quartet (recently appointed as resident quartet to the city of Aberdeen) tenor Jamie McDougall, and ballad singer Adam McNaughton. All in, a bumper evening and a blockbuster week for Scottish music. Composers of the Week: Jan 23-27. BBC Radio 3. 9-10 every morning.

The name of Dr Crippen sears the popular mind as a notorious medical murderer, but, as Robert Dickson reports, another and far more deadly doctor may have managed to elude justice LIKE all professions, medicine has harboured a few murderers in the past. The best known now is probably Dr Crippen, who poisoned his wife before dismembering her and concealing some remains underneath the flagstones of his cellar. But over the years other medical men have used their access to drugs to commit murder. While cases of domestic murder by a physician are rare, a 1957 trial of a doctor for the murder of one of his patients broke new ground. The information that it was just one example of what the police believed had been a series of similar cases was withheld from the jury and was only made public nearly 30 years later. John Bodkin Adams had been a general practitioner in Eastbourne for 30 years prior to his arrest. The subject of much gossip, because he had benefited from numerous patients' wills, Dr Adams was well known in the local community. A small portly man, he was often seen driving one of the two Rolls-Royces which he had been bequeathed and his house contained canteens of silver and other items left to him often in codicils added to wills a very short time before the patient died. He had received over 100 cash bequests in the years leading up to his arrest. Initial complaints centred around allegations that the doctor had used undue influence on dying elderly women. One niece tried to contest a will but lost; another relation queried the cheques in Dr Adams' favour signed in the last few days of her mother's life. She was equally unsuccessful. Only when the disquiet grew greater were questions raised as to the cause of death in some cases. The problem which faced Scotland Yard was that most of the codicils which left money to Dr Adams also added a wish by the testator to be cremated. The authorities accordingly had no bodies on which to do an autopsy, despite the suspicious circumstances. Superintendent Hannam noted that many of the deaths had taken place at a private nursing home in which Dr Adams had an interest. The matron, who knew the doctor well, was clearly distressed and ruffled by some of the superintendent's questions. One Friday evening the police officer returned to London convinced that when he came back to Sussex the witness would be ready to talk. Ten days later the superintendent returned to Eastbourne. There he learnt that his witness had died suddenly, Dr Adams had issued a death certificate, and she had been cremated two days previously. Notwithstanding this calamity it was decided that there was enough evidence to arrest Dr Adams. Which of the numerous cases under investigation should be used as the murder charge for the trial? For reasons which have baffled many since, the case of Edith Morrell -- a widow who had died six years before and her body cremated -- was selected. Accordingly no direct evidence existed of the cause of death, apart from Dr Adams' certificate, which indicated ''cerebral haemorrhage''. In the absence of a body, the prosecution relied on three factors at the preliminary hearing. Firstly, large quantities of morphine, heroin and paraldehyde had been prescribed and, according to the nurses, administered. Secondly, Dr Adams had benefited from the old lady's death. And thirdly, the administration of such huge drug dosages would kill, and no doctor would ever have considered such treatment. The evidence of the nurses was therefore vital, but they had only their recollection, six years after the death, to go on. Further defence counsel, Mr Geoffrey Lawrence, QC, persuaded each nurse to agree that if the nursing notes were available then evidence based on what they remembered would be substantiated. He then produced from among his own papers the missing notebooks. Nobody thought to ask if Mrs Morrell's case papers still existed and whether Dr Adams' advisers had managed to find them. For the Crown, worse was to follow. As well as contradicting the nurses' evidence on the patient's mental and physical state, the notes did not record the large doses claimed. Instead, when the drugs register appeared (like a rabbit from Mr Lawrence's hat) it was apparent that morphia was missing but that there was no record of its administration. The prosecution's medical expert made the fatal mistake of being unduly dogmatic. Alleging that no doctor would ever consider using such drugs in these circumstances, the expert however was forced to accept that his own hospital had done so on certain occasions. Erroneously believing that his evidence was largely formal and relying on the fact that it had passed unchallenged in the magistrates' court, he was ill-prepared for Mr Lawrence's brutal cross-examination. The Crown however remained convinced that once the cocksure Dr Adams entered the witness box he would talk himself into the condemned cell. Mr Lawrence, who disliked Dr Adams, probably thought the same, so the doctor exercised his right to remain silent. Faced with a prosecution case which had been repeatedly ambushed by the defence, the jury were left with little choice other than to acquit. Dr Adams returned to Eastbourne and resumed medical practice. The prosecution, deciding that one rebuff was enough, did not pursue the remaining murder allegations. Instead they charged the doctor with failing to keep adequate records of dangerous drugs. He pled guilty. The resulting fine allowed the General Medical Council to strike him off but his name was restored in 1961. As the years went by, journalists and newspaper correspondents coupled his name with Dr Crippen. In every case he threatened a libel suit and frequently recovered damages. Not until his death in 1983 did the true extent of the allegations against him come to light, and while nobody has ever proved that even one death was hastened by his injections, there are few who doubt that a brilliant defence lawyer and an incompetent presentation of the Crown case allowed a multiple killer to escape justice. It is ironic to realise that had Dr Adams practised in Elgin instead of Eastbourne his defence team would have been unable to sabotage the prosecution in the way in which they did. In Scotland there is no preliminary hearing and so the medical expert would not have been lulled into a false sense of security. Furthermore, the rules in relation to productions are different. Had the defence wished to use the missing nursing records or drugs register, on which the case ultimately hinged, they would have had to lodge them in court three days before the trial started. Had they done this in the case of Dr Adams the Crown would have been better prepared, and it might not have been possible to confuse the nurses to the same extent as Mr Lawrence had done.

RAITH Rovers have been given the go-ahead to stage their first ever European tie at Stark's Park. The Scottish first division club's Kirkcaldy ground has been passed for a 'normal risk' tie when the Coca-Cola Cup winners play in the UEFA Cup preliminary round next season. That means a 6630 capacity will be set at the ground, which holds 9300. Only if Rovers' tie is classed as 'high risk' might there be a change of venue. * ABERDEEN have beaten a host of clubs to sign Baldur Bett -- the son of former Scottish internationalist Jim -- on an 'S' form. Meanwhile, Bett senior looks set to remain with Hearts, despite reports linking him with a return to Pittodrie. He said: ''My contract with Hearts is up at the end of the month. I will assess the situation then discuss it with the manager, Tommy McLean.'' * FIFA yesterday sacked media chief Guido Tognoni and competitions director Miguel Galan. The decision was made by president Joao Havelange in agreement with general secretary Joseph Blatter over the reorganisation of FIFA's general secretariat.

WHILE Mark Maclean, the former Scottish No.1, has signalled the end of his squash career, Alan Thomson is bidding to make a return to the international scene. Maclean, arguably Scotland's greatest player until the arrival of Peter Nicol, insists he has not retired. But his actions suggest otherwise. He asked to have his name removed from the latest world-ranking list, and to return would be like starting again, as he would be forced to qualify for even the most minor events. ''Because of injuries, I've not been able to play. But I've not given up, and at the moment the priority is to get fully fit,'' said Maclean, who has played in seven world championships and represented Scotland on 88 occasions. Last year, Maclean's matches could be counted on one hand, while his last major event was the 1993 world championships in Pakistan. He was dropped from Scotland's team for last year's European championships, an event that had provided his career highlight when Scotland won the title in 1992. Thomson, meanwhile, is raring to go, having shrugged off the effects from the knee operation he underwent 18 months ago. Now 35, the Glasgow-born player is back in action in the Middlesex league, and reports that he is playing ''better than ever.'' The London-based Thomson has his sights set on a remarkable end-of-season double -- victory in the Scottish over-35 championship, and an international comeback at the European Championships in Holland.

Young Scottish composer Magnus Robb tells Elizabeth Clark about the past influences which inform his innovative style. THE word ''radical'' is derived from the Latin word for ''root'' -- a simple fact that suprisingly forms the basis of the mission statement of Edinburgh-born composer Magnus Robb. His latest piece, The Ancient Language of the Birds, is premiered this month by The Chamber Group of Scotland. For 24-year-old Robb, the creative process is a journey to the origins of music and language; only by investigating the past can he produce something new and, indeed, radical. Educated in Edinburgh, Robb's early musical encounters came in the viola sections of the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland and the Edinburgh Youth Orchestra. This experience was to inspire the then 16-year-old to compose. He says: ''I realised that playing in the viola section of an orchestra didn't contribute much to the whole.'' So Robb started composing and, having shown a completed score to fellow Edinburgh composer John McLeod, he found himself with a teacher who was to offer some essential advice: ''It may seem silly to an outsider, but to be told how to put your music down on paper and even which kind of pen to use was a very valuable lesson to learn.'' After school came a music degree at the University of York. Lessons from both David Blake and Roger Marsh were worthwhile but there was more to university life than simply composing. ''York had such an ideal environment for me to compose, get things performed, perform myself, and study the academic side of music. I learned more from the general atmosphere and from my fellow students than from anything else.'' On graduating from York in 1991, Robb entered his degree composition, a chamber piece entitled Delphi, for Amsterdam's Gaudeamus Festival. The piece was awarded a performance by a Dutch radio station, Nederlands Radio Kamerorkest, a major breakthrough for Robb. ''That was a very exciting time for me. I was pleased with the piece and the whole experience was very positive.'' The enthusiasm generated by this success was to be short-lived as a post-graduate course at London's Guildhall School of Music resulted in a disappointing year. ''The Guildhall didn't really match up to my expectations. It was a confusing time and I didn't compose much.'' However, there was to be some light at the end of the tunnel as the London experience revealed to Robb the lure of the Netherlands. ''I liked Amsterdam's music scene and I felt good there.'' Shortly after leaving London, Robb moved to Amsterdam to study with Louis Andriessen. Like Steve Martland and many other young composers, Robb speaks highly of Andriessen. ''Louis is very firm in his convictions. He knows exactly what he thinks about music and has some very strong bases for his thoughts -- although he won't force anything on you. Basically he's a very good flint to sharpen yourself on because he's very solid.'' When describing his own approach, Robb is sure of his role: ''Music cannot just be about expressing personal emotions -- it's more a result of expressing your limitations, but this isn't recognised by enough people.'' And what of the current trend for eclecticism? ''I suppose I'm eclectic in my sources of inspiration in that the things that excite me about music stem from various fields, but I attempt to integrate these different elements and make them whole so the result is not as eclectic as the concept.'' This idea is evident in Robb's latest composition. Commissioned by The Chamber Group of Scotland with Scottish Arts Council support, The Ancient Language of the Birds is an account of a woman's journey to the other world where her body is eaten up bit by bit by birds until only the bare bones are left. This ritual is then reversed as the body is reconstituted, cleansed and made whole. Robb explained the inspiration behind the piece: ''I was intrigued by a kind of vulture named the Lammergeier which lives entirely on a diet of bones. What interested me about this was that something which flies with such immense power could be driven by bone and the idea that bones are the roots of the energy essential for life.'' Future projects include a BBC Scotland commission for a string quartet to be performed at this year's Edinburgh Festival by the Yggdrasil String Quartet and a Radio 3 commission for a short piece for two singers. Robb is still reluctant to commit himself to a return to Scotland. ''The Netherlands is a great place to live but I still have my home in Edinburgh. Ideally I'd like to keep a foot in both camps.'' * The Ancient Language of the Birds will be performed by The Chamber Group of Scotland at the RSAMD, Glasgow, on Sunday and at the Queen's Hall, Edinburgh on Monday.

MIKE Catt received a twin boost yesterday. The Bath stand-off was chosen for his country for the first time -- out of position at full back -- for England's Five Nations Championship opener, against Ireland in Dublin on January 21. And he learned that Rugby Union president Dennis Easby did not expect any emergency changes in the team. Catt is the subject of an RU enquiry into his admission that he was paid for playing as a 20-year-old in South Africa three years ago. If found guilty of breaking international board regulations, Catt would have to be banned. But Easby said: ''I do not anticipate a change in selection after Friday's RU executive committee meeting, which will consider Catt's case.'' Manager Jack Rowell said that Catt had been picked on merit over Paul Hull, who was England's full back in their four most recent Tests. ''Hull was considered fit for selection, though we don't know whether he will be fit. But Catt displayed immense all-round skills as Hull's deputy against Canada and we are confident that he will do well.'' With Bath and Leicester both having four players in the England side, the clubs will be entitled to claim one player back for league duty this weekend, while the rest of the England squad take a day off. Rowell expects that Dean Richards will captain Leicester and that Catt will play stand-off for Bath. Team: M J Catt (Bath); T Underwood (Leicester), W D C Carling (Harlequins), captain, J C Guscott (Bath), R Underwood (Leicester); C R Andrew (Wasps), K P P Bracken (Bristol); J Leonard, B C Moore (both Harlequins), V E Ubogu (Bath), M O Johnson (Leicester), M C Bayfield, T A K Rodber (both Northampton), D Richards (Leicester), B B Clarke (Bath). Replacements -- J Callard, P R de Glanville (both Bath), C D Morris (Orrell), S O Ojomoh, R G Dawe (both Bath), G C Rowntree (Leicester).

STRATHCLYDE International Regatta is the major annual showpiece event of the Scottish Amateur Rowing Association and this year's competition, being held at the end of April, has now been given a substantial boost with the confirmation that a regional squad of rowers from Bergen, in Norway, will be taking part. The SARA is also currently negotiating with the Belgian Federation, who also seem keen to send a junior squad this year. Both of these moves, as well as the repeat use of the regatta by the British International Rowing Office for preliminary GB squad race trials, represent a major step-up in the standard of competition at the regatta. When news of these developments travels, there should also be a marked knock-on effect on the numbers and standard of entries that will come to the event from throughout Britain. Establishing the Strathclyde International Regatta as a truly major event has been one of the long-term aims of the SARA. The fact that Scotland's Olympic-standard course at Strathclyde Park will be the venue for the 1996 world championships is no doubt helping in this aim. Peter Morrison, chairman of the SARA's regatta organising committee, explains: ''Like the Norwegians and Belgians, many international federations will be keen to visit Scotland in the coming months to familiarise themselves with the course and the facilities that we have on offer. We will be exploring ways of bringing more international crews to our regattas in the run-up to the world championships.'' The move to early April for the regatta from its earlier high-season date also carries potential benefits. This year, there is no other event taking place on the same dates on the North of England circuit, so there is every chance that several of the clubs from that quarter will also wish to attend. Sponsorship negotiations are also currently under way with the operators of ferry services between Scotland and Belfast to make it easier for Irish clubs to take part as well.

SHE could have taken the easy way. Having served her apprenticeship with De Dannan, where singers play a patient secondary role to instrumentals, Eleanor Shanley could have opted for a full-blown band and a bland cruise into showbiz. Instead, she chose a pared-down ''band'' of two and a series of challenging settings, all of which she conquered with ease. The breadth of songs was as expected: some De Dannan stalwarts (including Raglan Road sung beautifully unaccompanied); a touch of Music Hall; a pop song or two. But some of the choices proved surprising. At first. Then suddenly Elvis's In The Ghetto was no longer Vegas fodder but a paean to, of course, the Irish/American experience, and singing Still I Love Him with just a bodhran for company seemed to have been the obvious way all along. Paul Brady also passed through a giant Irish folk band, Planxty, but he'd already eastablished himself in traditional music by then and what he'd learned there has played a crucial part in his career since he re-invented himself as a rock songwriter in the early eighties. Brady is a wholehearted performer who revels in a live performance. Even if he was slightly under par here, the honesty in his singing, the who-needs-a-band quality of his guitar playing, and the depth of his songwriting ability were of an order few attain. He may have forgotten the words to his old Planxty showcase, Arthur McBride and the Sargeant, but it still brought out the goosebumps, and new songs such as Beautiful World sounded well capable of doing likewise in the future.

NOT often enough do we get the chance to hear the world's finest singers away from the rigidity of opera and oratorio. Last night's solo recital by Spanish mezzo-soprano Teresa Berganza spotlighted a fabulous voice in a programme of vocal delights. A champion of the Spanish repertoire, it was in fact her interpretation of a handful of Faure songs which was to make the deepest impression. Casting an effortless spell, time stood still as she spun out the sublime melodic lines of Claire de Lune. Early in the recital, Berganza displayed her uncompromising versatility in an utterly tasteful airing of Haydn's Cantata Arianna a Naxos. Tense and immediate recitative contrasted with warm and breathy arias, the subtleties of her dynamic range simply amazing. In the final lament, her dramatic presence reached a peak where spirituality intervened to add a real emotional edge. In a Rossini selection, Berganza was able to display her incredible vocal pyrotechnics -- turning, trilling, flirting, and teasing -- all with impeccable diction and stunning control. Occasionally in her upper register, the notes weren't hit quite on the head but if I were singing like that at the age of 60, I wouldn't be complaining. On home ground for a second half of contemporary Spanish miniatures by Guridi, Halffter, and Turina, Berganza unveiled her wonderful accent combining dirty guttural consonants and gutsy vowels -- the results have to be heard to be believed. Although accompanist J A Alvarez Parejo displayed dexterity at the keyboard, the two failed to gel as a partnership. That said, Berganza is not one to disagree with -- if the piano is there to accompany rather than complement then so let it be.

CELTIC Connections laudably have placed a heavy emphasis on song writing this year, and in Tom Paxton, they made a surprisingly inspired choice to represent a much-maligned genre. Although Paxton referred at one point to his music as ''folk'', its simplicity (he is accompanied only by acoustic guitar and mandolin) ensured that he transcends simple categorisation. Lacking either the continued success or critical reference of his Greenwich Village contemporaries, Dylan and Ochs, Paxton has managed to preserve his muse in a way that few acclaimed sixties pop writers have managed. His voice is a sweet thing, too, but it is his skill in changing the mood from the frivolous and throwaway, to the sensitive and observant in the space of a song which makes for such an engaging show. Beginning with Bottle of Wine, Paxton then deviated into what he describes as his ''short life songs'' -- disposable, witty observations on events as diverse as Michael Jackson's marriage and the O J Simpson car chase. However, it is his best-known songs -- Can't Help But Wonder, Rambling Boy, and Did You Hear John Hurt -- and the newest ones, selections from his latest album, Wearing the Time like Passing Through Tulsa that show the other side of his work. This is a sensitive voyeur of both people and places. While ageing and the passing of time are major themes in his work, the nostalgia is rarely reduced to sickly sentiment. Paxton's gift should have been an inspiration to more: Glasgow's would-be song writers have another chance to learn and pay homage tonight. They would be negligent not to.

IT was a full house and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board at the table next to me had the bubbly flowing before a note rang out from the stage. I took this as a good omen for the show. Glasgow-born guitarist David Allison opened proceedings with an initially dazzling but finally soporific display of virtuosity aided by all manner of loops, delays and electronic trickery. Despite a rousing melody inspired by the removal of the Stone of Destiny from London (which drew loud applause from the NITB and moved them to pop another cork), the set tended to be one-paced and I found myself hoping for a song or two before the end. Nevertheless, his homage to Crinan (visited on holiday recently) was uplifting, while the treatment of an Asian theme was nothing short of pyrotechnic. Altan, on the other hand, shun most things ''technic''. Now recognised as Ireland's finest exponents of traditional folk music, they play fiddles, bouzouki, accordion, and guitar with a relaxed mastery which belies the foibles of a slip jig or slow air, while Mairead Ni Mhaonaigh continues to captivate with an effortless voice which sounds like a bell. More often than not calling on material from around the north of Ireland, they opened with a couple of pacy reels, followed that with a Donegal ballad, then upped the ante by taking the following pair of jigs, Sean O'Boyles and the King of the Pipers, flat out. The NITB roared, we followed, and the tone was set for the rest of what was a flawless performance from superbly understated musicians at the top of their craft.

It's all downhill for new ideas as modern fabrics help revolutionise fashion on the ski slopes, writes Francesca Fearon FOR her Rocky Mountain wedding before Christmas, former model Christie Brinkley wore a delicate pink mohair jacket over a stunning angora and taffeta ballgown to exchange vows on the snowy slopes with Rick Taubman, who was clad in tweed jacket and knickerbockers. They looked as if they had skied straight off an old fashion plate from Victorian times, when decorum overruled function. That era's flimsy, constricting clothes were romantic and genteel -- and a far cry from the futuristic, high-performance fabrics and svelte styling that come high on the list of skiers' priorities these days. They are conversant in the relative merits of hi-tech fibres like Tactel, Polartec, and Microft Vixy which would leave the uninitiated perplexed. They can discuss at length the function of a one-piece from Story, the style of a blouson from Ralph Lauren, the warmth of a fleece sweatshirt from Luhta's Tokka Tribe collection or the effectiveness of sunglasses from Bloc. Clothing is as important an ingredient to good skiing as the quality of the snow and the weather conditions -- and consumes as much of the conversation. Since the Italian designer Emilio Pucci designed himself the first truly chic ski-suit after the war, fashion trends have played an important role in ski-wear. Silver has added a shine to street fashion over the past few months and now it is streaking across ski-wear. Similarly, those flashy, neon brights of the catwalk get the skier noticed even in a white-out. Chanel's exuberant furry jackets are only for the brave apres-skier, perhaps, but Gucci's ski gloves and the DKNY's knitted beanies cut a lot of style on the slopes. Of course, a holiday in the mountains is not just about elegantly weaving your way around the beginners or slicing curves through virgin powder snow. There are the hellraisers on snowboards, the acrobats of freestyle, and the hip mogul-mowers who plough and jump the mogul field and the pursuers of not-as-easy-as-it-looks langlauf all negotiating the space on the mountainside. Each of these groups has stamped its identity on ski clothing. Snowboarders have inherited the laid-back, baggy styling of the rap and surfing culture, introducing fleecy cagoules (made in Polartec, a fabric using fibre unbelievably recycled from plastic bottles), loose hip-hop pants and jester ski hats made by Plain Sane. It is a wild and wacky image. The growing enthusiasm for snowboarding has prompted a host of new lines -- including Tokka Tribe by Luhta, available from leading sports shops; a collection of fleece tops and corduroy pants by snowboard specialist Low Pressure at Dr Jives in Glasgow; and jean-style jackets and lumberjack tops from C &amp; A. Freestyle skiers and mogul-mowers also like to display their peacock skills in chrome yellow, vivid red, turquoise and orange blousons -- all the better to watch them perform their aerial stunts. The Snow &amp; Rock mail order catalogue has a colourful collection for the exhibitionist in ranges from Story, Tenson, Killy and Degre 7. The Langlauf -- cross-country -- skiers, meanwhile, glide serenely across the landscape in windbreakers, cosy polos, leggings and headbands from the Triumph winterwear collection available from leading sports shops. Image is important wherever their obsession lies -- wintersports have an addictive element -- but so is the performance of the clothes. Millions have been spent in developing the perfect waterproof, breathable, rugged fabrics that can withstand the cold, wet, and abrasive conditions. The names of Tactel, Meryl, Polartec, Propile and Gore-Tex -- familiar to skiers everywhere -- each offer a different aspect of protection. Something that those elegant, but impractical Victorian garments couldn't hope to provide.

The revised plan for a national gallery in Glasgow will not be a watered-down affair, says Angus Grossart. Keith Bruce reports. ANGUS Grossart is at pains to put the saga of the proposal to site a new national gallery building in Glasgow in some sort of chronological context. The chairman of the board of trustees of Scotland's art collection is having no truck with the suggestion that the progress of the Big Idea is becoming overlong and drawn out. It is difficult to argue the point. The construction of a building to house the Burrell Collection took 44 years. The Festival Theatre became a home for opera in Edinburgh only after 30 years of debate. The National Museum of Scotland, currently under construction in Chamber Street, Edinburgh, was also first mooted three decades previously. ''In three years we have made major progress. We have established the appropriateness of having a national institution outside Edinburgh. That was a major agenda item and, to some, a revolutionary proposal,'' says Grossart. He claims that idea is now accepted -- even in Edinburgh -- following the lifting of the threat to the future of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Queen Street. Doubtless there are those in the capital who disagree, but while it seemed for a while that Scottish Secretary Ian Lang's rejection of the trustees' original preference for a new building in Kelvingrove Park might scupper the whole project there is no doubt the momentum has been building again. ''There were a number of issues that we were not prepared to let lie,'' says Grossart. ''There is too much of the collection not on display, and we have a responsibility for the whole of Scotland, not just to Edinburgh. Any good idea has an impetus of its own and the delivery factor in Glasgow is very high -- once you get everybody moving in the right direction.'' If Grossart is correct and the Edinburgh lobby is resigned, the movers and shakers in Glasgow are still in need of reassurance. Complying with Mr Lang's wish to see more public consultation, the trustees published a glossy booklet, Options for a National Gallery of Scotland in Glasgow, in December. It contained a pick'n'mix of possibilities for the content of the new gallery -- a collection of fine and applied art from 1837 to 1951 ''a sort of Musee D'Orsay for Scotland'', an exhibiting space taking long loans from Edinburgh, a theatre gallery, and a photography gallery. Simultaneously, it became clear that the favoured site had become the Post Office building in George Square, due to be vacated by the Royal Mail. Page and Park, the architects behind the proposal for the redevelopment of the nearby Sheriff Court building, now to be a hotel, have been working on preliminary designs. The plans have much in common, involving the retention of the facade, and much new-build behind it, although the structure of the Post Office building is altogether more appropriate to its proposed new purpose. ''To achieve the same result with an older building is harder work and often more expensive, and if a strong view emerged that people would prefer a new building on a new site we would listen to that, but it doesn't seem to be going that way,'' says Grossart. But if the size of the Post Office building, which takes up an entire city block, suggests a major project, the options for filling it set off alarm bells in Glasgow. While the Musee D'Orsay option had its supporters, Julian Spalding, Glasgow's director of art galleries and museums, memorably reacted that it sounded ''more 'sort of' than 'D'Orsay'''. Spalding was not alone in suspecting that the trustees had found themselves caught between a rock and a hard place -- committed to a Glasgow gallery but having to take into account lukewarm reaction from the Government (on whom they are dependent for the meeting of future running costs) -- and were scaling down their proposal to assuage the fears of the Edinburgh establishment. Those who combined forces to wrest the gallery proposal away from the capital were conscious that they were into a dangerous game. If they accepted what was on offer, they ran the risk of that being all the gallery ever amounted to and none of the options outlined filled the remit of being the major national institution the city requires to move up the league of European cities. There was also a feeling that not only was the gallery in danger of being too insignificant to qualify for Heritage Commission support (the trustees have applied for #30m of National Lottery money from the National Heritage Memorial Fund), it also would not be possible to demonstrate that it would have the required economic impact on the city in terms of jobs and tourists attracted to meet the criteria for the EC funding that was a significant factor in Glasgow winning the contest with Edinburgh in the first place. ''It is not worth us going for a project that is half-baked. If we go for EC funding and fail the egg is on our face,'' said one prominent Glasgow figure. Grossart insists that such concerns are ill-founded, and is critical of those voicing concerns that might hamper further progress. ''We want to get it as right as possible, but there is no good analysing and philosophising for decades, like the Burrell and the Festival Theatre, if at the end of the decade the account of your progress says 'bugger all'. ''We didn't embark on this process with the intention of producing something limited. It has to be substantial in scale and of high quality and capable of evolving. ''It needs a strong life of its own to develop and flourish and attract gifts and loans on its own merits.'' Glasgow School of Art is one of the bodies that has indicated that it might by prepared to lend some of its collection if the development were of a proper scale. Director Dugald Cameron said: ''I'm worried that it might be a fairly tentative thing. It should show Scotland's art, design and architecture and the links between them.'' This vision of the new gallery, which is also that of Spalding, finds favour with the trustees. Grossart notes that the period proposed for the D'Orsay option coincides with that of Glasgow's greatness in engineering and design. ''We have no inhibitions in these areas,'' he says, adding that the span of dates should not be taken as a set-in-stone inhibiting factor either. The truth of the extent of his inhibitions -- and those of National Galleries director Timothy Clifford -- can be tested tomorrow night, when the consultation process reaches Glasgow University's Bute Hall for a public meeting at 7pm. For Professor Malcolm McLeod, director of the neighbouring Hunterian Gallery -- another potential lender -- it is better late than never. ''Perhaps the sort of consultation that should have gone on beforehand is going on after,'' he suggested. Professor McLeod now hopes that consultation can be productive, without any interference from elsewhere: ''Wouldn't it be interesting if the westbound carriageway of the M8 was blocked at that time?'' Even that contentious view is not entirely rejected by the chairman of the trustees. Grossart says: ''The trustees are not in the business of being partisan about Glasgow, but it is sometimes seen from Edinburgh as this Pacific island which is visited by steamer every two years, rather than linked by a soon-to-be-15 train service.''

AFTER a famine of racing over New Year, when meetings at Ayr and Edinburgh were abandoned because of frost, Scottish punters are promised a feast at Kelso today. Trainers on both sides of the Border, whose horses have been confined to stables because of the weather and are eager to be back in business, have swamped the meeting, with 86 runners for the seven races. Despite recent gloomy statements by the British Horseracing Board about a scarcity of chasers, the #5000 Bet with Tote Novices Chase attracted 24 runners, requiring the event to be split, and the first race brought forward by half an hour. The last race holds more than usual interest for a group of 40 Kelso members, with the participation of their own horse, Aragon Ayr, leased from Peter Monteith, in the Federation Brewery Hurdle. A winner of three races from nine starts last season, his re-appearance has been delayed because of the need for soft ground. Aragon Ayr was to have galloped at Kelso after racing in November, but the ground was too firm, and he was denied a run in the New Year Hurdle at Ayr when the meeting was called off. Monteith, who also has Back Before Dawn in the race, warned yesterday that Aragon Ayr, with on top weight of 11st 10lbs, ''may need the run.'' The Rutherford Handicap Chase, the feature race of the meeting, has attracted several fine chasers from the north of England, including Hudson Bay Trader, a stable-mate of Jodami, and Four Deep, a winner over the course and distance in October. Scottish interests are representd by Dawn Goodfellow's Ceilidh Boy, a course specialist with four wins, Len Lungo's Nawrik, who is suited by a test of stamina, and Monteith's Bennan March, who beat Absailor here in November. Mary Reveley, on the 60-winner mark and currently fifth in the national championship, is sending a strong team. She could win the first four events with Brave Buccaneer, Bayrouge, Srivijaya, and Mr Woodcock, all ridden by Peter Niven.

BT's well-signposted move into the German telecommunications market was generally welcomed by analysts yesterday. BT is to form an alliance with Viag, one of the country's largest industrial companies, to offer telecommunications services in Germany. Germany is the largest telecommunications market in Europe. Both companies will have 37.5% of the new venture with the remaining 25% to be taken up by other German partners. The alliance will invest #600m in the market over the next 10 years. It is BT's first step in its aim of winning a full telecoms licence in Germany to offer a complete range of telecommunications services, including calls for residential customers, when the market is liberalised. In line with European Union policy this is due to take place by January 1, 1998, but BT hopes that it will take place earlier, perhaps as soon as next year. The alliance, to be known as Viag InterKom KG, will be headquartered in Munich. It is planning to offer international call services from April for national and international business customers. These will include international call and advanced data services currently offered by Concert -- the BT and MCI global network company -- and will quickly be followed by medium-sized, multi-site companies aimed at providing domestic services. BT chairman Sir Iain Vallance commented: ''We are delighted to have reached this agreement with Viag. We now view the whole of Europe as our home market and this represents BT's single largest investment there outside the UK. This is a major step in our plans to become a leading alternative to selected incumbent European operators such as Deutsche Telekom.'' Viag's presence in the German telecommunications market is through its subsidiary TB &amp; D, which is set to provide Viag's corporate network. Dr Alfred Pfeiffer, chairman of the Viag management board, said: ''Viag now regards telecommunications as becoming an increasingly important part of its activity and we look forward to it becoming a core element of our business. ''The impending liberalisation of the German market, currently worth about #29bn and set to grow at 6% annually, offers considerable opportunities.''

JOCKEY Jason Weaver had a busy and interesting day at Lingfield yesterday -- but not all for the correct reasons. The 23-year-old was in front of the stewards three times in all, the first of which when he collected a two-day ban for improper riding on Avant Huit, third in the maiden race, where he used his whip with unreasonable force. Two hours later the course officials again summoned the rider, keen to know why he appeared to stop riding Pageboy in the closing stages of the Repulse Handicap. However, Weaver's explanation that the saddle had slipped was accepted. Weaver wound up the afternoon on a high, partnering Dome Patrol to victory in the last, but even then the stewards had a look at some interference on the final bend but ruled that the trouble was accidental. Earlier, Weaver had initiated a double with an armchair ride on Pat Haslam's Nigel's Lad, who had been heavily backed when third at Wolverhampton on Saturday. * EDINBURGH is one of eight courses to have an additional fixture in February and March to replace those lost since last April. The meetings is scheduled for March 6. * CAPTAIN Dibble, winner of the Scottish National, has been retired. Connections made the decision after the 10-year-old failed to fire in the recent Anthony Mildmay, Peter Cazalet Chase at Sandown, where he was tailed off.

Airdrie 2, St Mirren 0 AIRDRIE revived their promotion challenge with their first win in five games, but struggling Saints are still without an away league win. English-born striker Steve Cooper set the Diamonds on the victory trail with his tenth goal for the club. Airdrie scorned several chances and Cooper was the chief sinner, but he made amends in 20 minutes when he netted from Tony Smith's cross. Paul Harvey twice came close on the restart and Cooper hit the bar but Andy Smith made the points secure in 77 minutes when he bundled the ball home from a Harvey cross. Clydebank 0, Hamilton 0 RANGERS manager Walter Smith carried out a spy check on Accies, his Tennents Scottish Cup rivals, but saw them on an evening when they laboured after a bright opening. Hamilton signed midfielder Raymond McStay from Celtic just before the kick-off and decided to include the youngster. The visitors looked the likelier side but missed chances. Gary Clark weakly diverted the ball into the keeper's hands, and Martin McIntosh was allowed to carry on as the home defence waited in vain for offside but he shot straight at Gary Matthews. Berwick Rangers 3, QOS 1 BERWICK chalked up their third successive win but they made heavy weather of subduing a visiting team who were down to 10 men after Brian McKeown was sent off for dissent in 44 minutes. Queens made a great start when Duncan Campbell went past two defenders to score in two minutes. Berwick fought back well, and after two shots had been blocked, Paul Greenwood marked his senior debut with the equaliser in 18 minutes. John Gallagher blasted in a Tommy Graham pass in 50 minutes to put the home side in front. Two minutes from time Willie Irvine netted from the spot after Graham had been upended. Stenhousemuir 2, Meadowbank 1 STENHOUSEMUIR were superior in all departments but trailed at the interval. Eight minutes from half-time Meadowbank opened against the run of play through Thorburn's curling drive. 'Muir equalised in 69 minutes when an Adrian Sprott corner was headed home by Euan Donaldson. With nine minutes left Miller Mathieson netted the winner from close in.

A DECADE ago, the Regulators might have been a rock band or a troupe of TV puppets. The word did not exist in the political lexicon. Today, they make many of the most important decisions affecting daily life. Take three recent examples. First, the Highlands and North-east of Scotland are threatened with ''more frequent power cuts'' because the electricity Regulator has not given Scottish Hydro Electric the price increase that they claim to require to allow maintenance of equipment. As the privatised successor to Tom Johnston's great social vision, Hydro Electric are answerable only to the Regulator. While within the public sector, they would never have dared threaten more frequent power cuts. There was ministerial responsibility. There would have been a great public furore and invoking of the social remit. Now it is a private battle between company and Regulator, to be adjudicated by the Monopolies Commission. Nothing to do with us, Ministers will say, if the lights flicker in the glens. Write to the Regulator. Then there are the boardroom excesses and dividend bonanzas in the public utilities. Fortunes are being made out of basic services -- water, gas, electricity. Nothing to do with us, say Ministers. These are private companies. Speak to the Regulator. You cannot have dividends increasing at three or four times the Stock Market average without huge profits, which consumers pay for through prices and employees through redundancies. The whole cycle is dependent on benign, Tory-appointed Regulators, who pronounce the profits to be ''reasonable''. Third, consider the weekend fiasco involving the rail Regulator -- a creature invented to facilitate privatisation. Belatedly sensing the political risks in removing through-ticketing from a couple of thousand stations, the Transport Secretary rushed in with a guarantee that he would veto any such plan. That was on Saturday night. By Monday morning, Dr Mawhinney was back to hiding behind the Regulator, as Mr Major did again yesterday. It was up to this mysterious man, the Regulator, to decide where through-tickets would be available. Ministers could only offer ''guidance''. What an extraordinary power has been vested in this unknown, unelected, unaccountable figure. If Messrs Mawhinney and Major are to be believed, they are mere bystanders; unable to stop him in his tracks as he creates mayhem around the country. ''It's the Regulator who runs the railway,'' they plead. Much of this should be taken with a pinch of salt. As Tony Blair pointed out yesterday, the obligation to maintain through-ticketing could be built into franchise conditions for train operators. The real reason they won't impose it is that private train companies would not want to sell the tickets of another couple of dozen operators, which is what through-ticketing under the fragmented railway would involve. But the mere fact that Ministers, including the Prime Minister, should seek protection behind the coat-tails of the Regulator is an indication of how change has worked to the detriment of accountability. Ministers no longer answer for themselves, in respect of the great public services and utilities. The buck has been passed to these supposedly independent, but politically appointed, Regulators. As a by-product of the privatisation programme, Regulators were appointed to deal with issues of competition. The Thatcherite theory was that after a while ''the market'' would take over and the need for regulation and Regulators would disappear. That is not how it has worked out. Competition -- the supposed justification for privatising the utilities -- remains elusive. For most people, switching on the light or the tap involves no element of choice. By and large, it is not competition which requires the attention of the Regulators, but the excesses of private monopolies which have been enshrined as licences to print money. Around one-fifth of the British economy is now under the control of Regulators, who have no accountability worth speaking about to Parliament or public. These, you might say, are the ultimate quangos. Almost without exception, they have been handed to safe Tory appointees who have seen it as their jobs to oil the wheels of profit-taking and monopoly. There are various proposals for making the Regulators more accountable to Parliament and people. But the short-term priority must be to have Regulators whose loyalty is to consumers rather than to shareholders, and whose belief in public services outweighs awe for the free market. The last time there was a Labour government, the Regulator breed did not exist. Now it does. That is an enormous change, which can be turned to advantage. It is moonshine to believe that all the public utilities are going to return to public ownership, but this does not mean that public objectives cannot be fulfilled through them. That is what the role of Regulators will, in future, be about. The industries which are already privatised will have to adjust to these changed circumstances. In the case of the railways, the warning should be heeded by potential investors. Under Labour, the Regulator would certainly not be the poodle of privatisation.

CELTIC midfield player Raymond McStay, youngest of the three brothers at Parkhead, has signed for Hamilton Accies on a free transfer. The 24-year-old has been with Celtic since he joined them from their boys club seven and a half years ago but has never made it to a regular first-team spot. ''He is a great lad, '' said manager Tommy Burns, ''and we wish him well. He has been on a monthly contract and is unfortunate in that we are well served in midfield.'' Brothers Paul, the Parkhead captain, and Willie, the youth coach, will be sorry to see Raymond go, but he agreed that he needed to play first-team football. ''I'm happy to join Hamilton,'' said Raymond. ''I was beginning to feel jinxed after what happened at Northampton. ''They asked me down for signing talks. I agreed, but a day later the manager, John Barnwell, was sacked. * Thomson denies receiving payment for his assistance in transfer deals. No evidence of him having received money for his involvement has been found, but, the report says: ''there is a clear and widely held perception that he was not involved in this matter for altruistic reasons. ''The conclusion is that, irrespective of whether Thomson received payment or not, he should not be involved in this way.''

Lucy Lockhart recommends a visit to two or three schools before making a choice AT present, Scotland has 75 independent schools which are members of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and the Independent Schools Information Service (ISIS). Collectively, they represent some 90% of the Scottish independent sector pupils, currently a total of 31,038. What exactly is the definition of an independent school? The term means a school offering full-time education to a minimum of five pupils, which is neither managed by an education authority, nor grant-aided. This certainly doesn't mean that such schools are totally free agents able simply to set their own agenda, and answerable only to themselves. Member schools are registered with the Scottish Office Education Department and are regularly inspected by Her Majesty's Inspectors of Schools. Most are affiliated to at least one professional association such as the Independent Schools Association Incorporated (ISAI), or the Governing Bodies Association (GBA). The examinations undertaken at each school vary, but a senior school in Scotland will usually first work towards the Scottish Certificate of Education Standard Grade (SCE S) or the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE). Then it's on towards SCE H (Highers), and probably Scottish Certificate of Sixth Year Studies (SCSYS), with many also offering the General Certificate of Education -- Advanced Level (GCE A), and some the General Certificate of Education Advanced Supplementary (GCE AS). Some schools offer Scotvec (Scottish Vocational Education Council Modules). While a number will prepare pupils for the Royal Society of Arts examinations (RSA). Schools, like all businesses these days, have to make great efforts to keep their charges or fee levels as competitive as possible -- not easy in enterprises which are extremely labour intensive, with salaries forming the greatest part of their expenditure. ISIS figures for 1994/95 show average termly day fees (based on 69 schools), are #1450, an increase of 3.94% over the previous session, with an average boarding fee (based on 37 schools) of #3015 per term, an increase of 4.06% over the year. In Junior/Prep schools, average termly day fees (based on 26 schools) are #1350, an increase of 3.64%, with the figure for boarding (based on 14 schools) averaging #2665, 3.67% up on the year. The Assisted Places Scheme, hugely successful and begun by the Government in 1981, exists to help those parents who would otherwise be unable to find the means to pay for independent education. It is open to pupils aged 10 by July 31, at the start of the school year in which the assisted place is to begin. Basically, for those eligible, the scheme pays fees (tuition only, not boarding) on a sliding scale according to parental income. Queries about the scheme, according to Rose Bell of ISIS, form the greatest area of interest from parents seeking information on independent schools. Those schools which participate in the Assisted Places Scheme, are listed in the SCIS/ISIS booklet, Which School? A Directory of Independent Schools in Scotland, available free on request, from: SCIS/ISIS (Scotland), Floor 2/1, 11 Castle Street, Edinburgh EH2 3AH (telephone 0131 220 2106). The directory contains a complete list of all schools which are members of SCIS, with details of their geographic location, numbers of pupils, the examinations for which pupils are prepared, the type of education offered -- nursery, junior, prep, senior or all-through; day and boarding schools, and the fee levels. For parents who do not already have a particular school in mind for their child, reference to the Which School? guide will provide some useful background information with which to make a start. Write to the school which interests you most, requesting their prospectuses, to get a more in-depth picture of what they are all about. Nothing can take the place of visits to two or three schools which sound if they offer the kind of educational, extra curricular and general ethos which you seek for your child. Talking to the head, being given a tour of the school and its facilities, enables parents to see and hear the day-to-day working of it, how the pupils and staff come across in terms of enthusiasm, rapport, attitude and manners; how well it appears to be run and what is going on within and outwith its many departments. Don't be intimidated: have all your questions ready to ask -- writing them down beforehand is a good idea, and be sure that you don't leave without getting the answers. The school you finally select should be a well-informed choice. If you are interested in the Assisted Places Scheme, make that known to the headmaster or headmistress who will be able to give you appropriate advice and information. It is also worth checking what, if any, financial help the school may be able to offer, in terms of special bursaries, scholarships and so on.

WITHIN the independent sector are a number of specialist schools which offer particular areas of expertise from teaching children of high ability, who may have learning difficulties, through those who have educational or social problems, to boys and girls with special gifts, such as musical talents. The latter is the specialism of St Mary's Music School in Edinburgh's West End, a co-educational day and boarding school with 53 pupils between the ages of nine and 18. Later this year, it will move from Manor Place to Coates Hall, less than half a mile away, which the school bought for #650,000. All its pupils, drawn from around Scotland, are either on Government-aided places or Cathedral Scholarships -- the school educates the choristers of the nearby St Mary's Episcopal Cathedral. Alongside their specialised musical training which covers the broadest spectrum, pupils are given a full general education, taught in small classes. This, according to the school, results in excellent academic achievements. St Mary's pupils are selected through auditions, and are put forward either by their school or sometimes, parents. The official auditions are held in February, but both the director of music and the master of choristers preside at unofficial auditions throughout the year. While most pupils will go on to further musical training and careers, others opt to pursue different routes: one pupil who left recently is now studying medicine at Edinburgh University, while another, a fine pianist, and also academically gifted, combined a course at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester with a degree at the university there, which he undertook in tandem. The end of June will see the removal take place from the busy, noisy present location, to the peaceful new building -- formerly a theological college -- tucked at the end of Rosebery Crescent, and surrounded by the luxury of garden ground, a tennis court and car parking. Among the desks, cupboards, books and all the other paraphernalia of a school, a host of musical instruments -- including 26 pianos -- will have to be moved. Coates Hall, before the start of next session, will have a science laboratory added, along with a staff flat and a number of bedsits for resident teachers. Headmaster Philip Allison says he is delighted at the prospect of moving St Mary's into its fine new building. Staff and pupils will at last be able to open windows, freed from the current deafening roar of traffic, and, further luxury, the concert hall will no longer require to be double glazed . . . all of which must be music to St Mary's ears.

GOVERNMENT and industry must make greater efforts to explain crop biotechnology to the general public, said Mr Michael Jack, Minister of State for Agriculture, yesterday. Any work involving genetics was only too likely to arouse public fears of scientists trying to play God, he told delegates to the Home-Grown Cereals Authority's annual research and development conference at Cambridge. ''In the case of our crop molecular genetics programme, such fears are totally unfounded,'' he said. But it did underline the need to explain what was going on, and why. These advanced breeding technologies were designed to offer UK growers the opportunity to produce crops tailored to the needs of the market. These would incorporate novel genetic resistance mechanisms for pests and disease control, and easier weed management. Significant progress in achieving greater yields had been seen in the past 20 years or so, but discussions with the seeds and plant breeding sectors had indicated the biggest barrier to further progress was the lack of predictable gene transfer systems and biological switches to turn genes on and off when, and where, in the plant they were needed. The latest MAFF and industry-funded programme on molecular genetics for wheat, barley, and oats, would help create a greater understanding of the genetic control of desirable characteristics; allow greater predictability of breeding results; and provide quicker and cheaper tests. But as well as communicating the need for this work to the public, there was also an obvious need to communicate more results of technological developments to the end users. In addition to the HGCA agronomy update roadshows, MAFF was developing its own systems of technology transfer. These included the funding of four new regional technology centres, and progress towards making greater use of the Department of Trade and Industry's business link and teaching company schemes. ''Cereals are a vitally important part of UK agriculture, accounting for some 16% of agricultural land -- with an output valued at over #2 billion, and exports of grain alone running at over four million tonnes,'' said Mr Jack. ''But the future prosperity of the UK cereals industry will depend on how the industry manages the changing agricultural and market priorities resulting from such things as CAP reform, the recent Gatt agreement, and increasingly demanding environmental and food safety standards.''

JENNY Allen, Scotland's most capped badminton player, is set to retire after the world championships, which will take place in Lausanne in May. However, there is another goal which the 30-year-old from Edinburgh would like to achieve before hanging up her racket, after a career in which she has won more than 100 caps and numerous titles. Next month Allen will line up at Meadowbank Sports Centre in the capital with sister Elinor in an attempt to claim their ninth national women's doubles title, and Jenny admits that the chance to increase the tally to 10 is an attractive prospect. ''Winning 10 national titles, paticularly with Elinor as my partner, would be something to rank alongside 100 caps,'' she said. ''Unfortunately, we lost in the semi-finals a couple of years ago or it could have been 10 by now.'' Whether or not the lure of another title will keep her in the sport remains to be seen, but sister Elinor also appears to be winding down her efforts, a sign that a new era could be dawning for the sport in Scotland, with space at the top up for grabs where formerly the Allens have dominated for more than a decade. Having succeeded in pulling off the elusive treble at last years Hydro-Electric national championships, Elinor has chosen not to defend the singles title this year and will now concentrate on doubles with Jenny and Kenny Middlemiss, leaving Anne Gibson a clearer passage to an expected fifth title. Meanwhile, in the men's competition, 22-year-old Bruce Flockhart is the favourite to pick up his second national singles title, with a convincing lead in the Scottish rankings and a win at last weekend's Wilson-Dunfermline Open to his credit already. However, the Stirling University student will miss the chance to pick up additional ranking points this weekend, as he will be competeting in Denmark and will miss the East of Scotland Open.

Anne Johnstone reports that the new Jobseeker's Allowance to replace Unemployment Benefit is going to be a major political battleground during 1995 PROPER targeting of scarce resources or a spiteful attack on the unemployed? The Government's Jobseeker's Allowance, due to replace Unemployment Benefit next year, looks like becoming one of 1995's hottest political potatoes. In the Commons yesterday Employment Secretary Michael Portillo told MPs that the allowance will help people into jobs, deliver a better service while they are unemployed, and give better value for the taxpayer. The main saving, some #180m a year, will be achieved by means-testing the new allowance after six months. Unemployment benefit, which it replaces, is currently payable without a means test for a year. The old distinction between unemployment benefit and income support disappears. There is also a package of measures aimed at getting people back to work, or at least out of the dole queue, which isn't necessarily the same thing. There's to be National Insurance Holidays for employers taking on someone who's been unemployed for two years or more and an ingenious back-to-work bonus for unemployed people taking on part-time work which enables them to build up credits equal to half of what they lose in benefit. If the part-time job leads to full-time employment, they then receive a bonus of up to #1000. Along with the carrots come the sticks, namely a series of measures which will penalise those who refuse work or aren't deemed ''willing to work''. In some cases they may be obliged to attend training courses or work on a Government-backed programme. This all falls a long way short of the American style ''workfare'' system which many predicted was heading this way when the changes were mooted last summer. The Tory right has long been attracted to the idea of making people work for their benefits but close scrutiny of the way it works in America shows that it is an expensive and inefficient way of getting people back to work and creates the sort of hard-luck stories which the Opposition would exploit with glee. Given that the Government already possesses powers to penalise those ''not actively seeking work'', it is hard to tell how much the sanctions in the Bill are a new crusade against the ''work shy'' and how far simply rhetoric designed to appeal to Tory backwoodsmen. The Scottish TUC, which has just launched a major campaign against the Bill, believes that the emphasis on ''presentational skills'' means that unemployed people will stand to lose benefit because of their dress or appearance. Shadow Social Security spokesman, Donald Dewar, says he sees it as another step along the road of disallowing an increasing proportion of claims. In 1991, he says, about 48% of claims referred for scrutiny were disallowed. By the first quarter of last year the figure had risen to 72%. ''A large part of the Bill is all about making life more difficult for the unemployed,'' says Dewar. The back-to-work bonus is certainly a clever incentive but given the relatively small number of full-time jobs on offer is unlikely to put money into more than a few thousand pockets. The National Insurance holiday is the sort of measure which both employers and trade unions have called for but at an average of #6 a week it's a rather weedy carrot. Labour claim employers could be offered as much as #70 a week for taking someone out of benefit without any extra cost to the taxpayer. But debate will focus on the reduction to six months of the right to benefit for the unemployed, regardless of means. ''Our concern is that the Government has increased National Insurance contributions from 9% to 10% but at the same time is cutting a contributory benefit,'' said Grahame Smith of the STUC. Labour predict that 250,000 people will lose benefit as a result of the change. In Strathclyde alone, where according to the latest figures there are more than 22,000 people who have been unemployed for between six months and a year, more than #10m will be lost to the local economy in benefit payments at a conservative estimate. The brunt of the cuts will be borne by white-collar workers with savings or substantial redundancy payouts, couples where the other member is still working and those between 18 and 25 who were eligible for full unemployment benefit but who will now be forced back on income support at a lower rate. John Hills, of the LSE, a respected authority on income distribution, says his main concern about Jobseeker's Allowance (JSE) is the impact on couples: ''A big contributor to the increasing gap between rich and poor in Britain is the widening gulf between families with two incomes and those with none. If the social security system is to blame for this then the new allowance will make things worse. If a man loses his job but his wife is still working, they stand to lose benefit after six months.'' Michael Portillo made much yesterday of the importance of incentives to work, a popular Tory theme. However, according to Hills, for many couples, the partner left in work when the other loses it may now have stronger incentives to stay at home. In other words, the problem with targeting benefits in this way is that it puts more people into the poverty trap. Many couples will soon be in the curious position of being better off on benefit unless both can find a job at the same time. According to Morag Gillespie of the Scottish Low Pay Unit, an analysis of employment statistics across Glasgow constituencies shows that the city is becoming increasingly divided into ''work rich'' and ''work poor'' households. However, there is no Labour commitment to restore full unemployment benefit to a year. If elected, Labour will have the same problem to face as the Conservatives: the fact is that the welfare state costs every working person in Britain #15 a day and even with the cuts proposed in this Bill, that figure is set to rise.

MICHAEL Atherton was on the radio from deepest Australia. ''I never said the captain should pick the England team,'' he insisted. ''I was quoted out of context -- please make that clear.'' It was just another minor public-relations blip during a tour on which disaster has been the ever-present twelfth man. England have a tour manager who is invisible, a team manager who is not even told when a replacement has been summoned from home, a chairman of selectors who is on holiday in Spain. Atherton has not had his sorrows to seek. Yet he has touched upon a fundamental question which affects almost all sports, namely, who should choose the team? Cricket is one of the few remaining games where the captain has to make vital decisions -- who bowls, which field will be set, when to declare. Is there anyone better qualified to say which players should take the field? Or is it unfair to place so much responsibility in the hands of one man? What if he is not playing well -- would he drop himself? That situation arose twice on British Lions rugby tours. A Scot, Michael Campbell-Lamerton, then skipper of the 1966 Lions in Australia and New Zealand, left himself out, after consultation with the team management, of a Test match. A later Lions' captain, Ciaran Fitzgerald of Ireland, pointedly declined to do the same when the vast majority of observers considered he was an inferior hooker to Scotland's Colin Deans. But should either player have been put in that position? I think not. To me, the notion that players should also be selectors is absurd. By all means let their views be sought, but to require them to pass judgement on club-mates, friends, sometimes even relatives, is asking far too much. Nor am I a great fan of selection committees. The late, great Jimmy Wardhaugh used to amuse with his tale of how, having been chosen to play for Scotland, he was given personal instruction by one of the selectors, a butcher from Montrose, as I recall, on how to take a throw-in. Ian McLauchlan swears that, after he was dropped from the Scottish international rugby team, all five selectors solemnly assured him they had voted for his inclusion. We will learn this afternoon the XV who will be wearing the Scottish jerseys against Canada a week on Saturday, and will be assured, no doubt, that every selection was unanimous. Perhaps, but it would be a lot easier to believe if it was the team manager's sole responsibility. For that is what I believe is the correct method. The football authorities have got it right -- Craig Brown, Terry Venables, Jack Charlton have been chosen to produce successful sides, and they have to be allowed to choose them. English cricket has far too many chiefs, but no commander. If Raymond Illingworth is to play that role he must be given the responsibility of selecting the side which takes the field. In an amateur sport like rugby, do different criteria apply? Well, let us not argue the ''amateur'' label, but rather look at what is happening in the real world. Does anyone other than Jack Rowell pick the England side? Does Ian McGeechan have control of team selection at Northampton? Of course he does. These men will listen to advice, they will have their spies in all the leading clubs up and down the country, they will talk to the coaches and maybe even to the players but ultimately the buck will stop with them. Just as soccer dispensed with the services of the butcher and the baker so, too, will international rugby. We are moving towards a professional team manager charged with putting the side he wants into action. I am happy to live with that prospect. One singer, one song. * GOING to the dogs on a Sunday would once have been considered the ultimate sin. Yet I have no qualms about releasing the hare on the Sabbath. Sunday horseracing will be with us soon on a regular basis, and I suspect rugby will consider staging some games on that day, too. This already happens in France. Of course there must be consideration given to those who have religious objections to taking part. But it is a hardly logical to insist that players must take part in Sunday training sessions yet say it is immoral to play an actual match.

BORIS Becker will not be discussing his Davis Cup intentions with compatriot Michael Stich, even though the German tennis stars will be together for the next four days in the lead-up to next week's Australian Open. The two former Wimbledon champions are both in the eight-man field for the Colonial Classic exhibition event at Kooyong, the former site of the year's first Grand Slam tournament. But Becker indicated yesterday that he saw no point talking to Stich about Davis Cup matters while behind-the-scenes negotiations continue on the subject between his manager and German officials. ''He's obviously said he's going to play, so we're in two different boats,'' commented Becker, adding that no decision had yet been reached on whether he would represent Germany in 1995. ''We have to decide before the first match, so it will obviously be some time in the next two weeks.'' Germany are due to face Croatia in the first round from February 3 to 5. Becker was the inspirational figure behind Germany's successive triumphs in 1988 and 1989, but his absence from the squad in recent years has become one of the longest-running sagas in the sport. The three-times Wimbledon champion has a 33-2 record in Davis Cup singles but is reluctant to commit himself to playing in every tie. Stich has said he will make himself unavailable if Becker is allowed to pick and choose his dates. There is a lot of money at stake on all sides, but Becker is currently more concerned with his preparations for the year's first Grand Slam tournament at Flinders Park, starting on Monday. He plays Australia's Jason Stoltenberg today, the opening day of the Classic, organised by ex-Australian Open director Colin Stubs. Other matches pit Pat Cash against Michael Chang, and world No.1 Pete Sampras against Wally Masur. Sampras said on Monday he viewed Andre Agassi as his main rival for the top spot. But Becker repeated his belief that there was more than one contender for the position. Becker also voiced some familiar complaints, notably about the way the ranking system works, the enforcement of the 25-second rule between points at major tournaments, and the age at which young girls should be allowed to join the tour. The format of this week's event is also unusual, with the winners of first- round matches going forward into one four-man section which will eventually yield the winner, while the losers form a second group to contest fifth to eighth places. * UNSEEDED Richard Fromberg upset top seed Marc Rosset yesterday to lead a strong Australian challenge in the first round of the New South Wales Open in Sydney. He beat the erratic Swiss 6-4, 6-4 to join compatriots Mark Woodforde, Todd Woodbridge, Jamie Morgan, and Michael Tebbutt in the second round. No.5 seed Petr Korda was a casualty, losing 2-6, 6-3, 6-2 to Italy's Renzo Furlan. In the women's singles, Swiss prodigy Martina Hingis recovered from a break down in the final set to beat America's Meredith McGrath 3-6, 6-2, 6-4. The 14-year-old now meets the American top seed, Lindsay Davenport.

ANDY Cole yesterday became British football's most expensive player when he headed south from Newcastle to join Manchester United. The 23-year-old striker joins the English champions for #6m, with Northern Irish international winger Keith Gillespie heading for St James's Park. Cole, who has signed a five-and-a-half-year deal which will keep him at United until the year 2000, became the twenty-seventh man bought by Alex Ferguson in his eight years in charge at Old Trafford. The United manager, who has now spent around #32m since taking over the club, said: ''We were surprised when we did not get a rebuff from Kevin Keegan when I spoke to him on Friday. ''We started negotiation because Kevin was interested in Keith Gillespie and very keen to have him. At that point we had to reconsider because he's a good young player, but sometimes you have to give something to get something. ''We never thought we could get Andy. His goal-scoring record is unbelievable and, hopefully, he will get the goals to make us a better team.'' Martin Edwards, United's chief executive, described himself as ''absolutely delighted'' to welcome Cole, who has scored 68 goals in 22 months at St James' Park, to Old Trafford. And the player himself was naturally very pleased. ''It's a brilliant move,'' he said. ''I wouldn't have gone anywhere else. I'm excited about the things that will hopefully come from it over the next five years. ''It was a big shock because I didn't think Newcastle would sell me to an English club. But as soon as I knew they was interested in the deal I made my mind up to come here. ''I had a bust-up with Kevin Keegan last season but I never said I wanted to leave Newcastle.'' * IAN ATKINS, the former Colchester, Cambridge, and Doncaster manager, is the new man in charge off Division III strugglers Northampton. Thirty-seven-year-old Atkins succeeds John Barnwell, who was sacked almost a fortnight ago. * MIKE Pejic has left second-division Chester after just seven months in charge. Chester fans have chanted for Pejic to quit during recent games as his troubled side have slumped to the bottom of the second division without winning a game since November 19. They have lost their last five home games and conceded 20 goals in the process. Pejic's assistant, former Everton and Wales skipper Kevin Ratcliffe, took training yesterday.

SINCE its creation in 1978 Kenneth Macleod Travel has gained a reputation among its customers for providing a service with a personal touch. And by recognising individuals' holiday and travel requirements, the company has developed a strong bond with its loyal clientele. Kenneth Macleod, founder of the company, now in semi-retirement, has not entirely cut links with the business and he will remain as chairman and he plans to escort groups to the Far East and Spain this year. Customers need not feel concerned about the restructuring that has taken place within the company. The standard of service and personal attention enjoyed by them is ensured continuity because the business has been bought by its existing directors. Elaine Tait, Simon Gemmell and Julian Stark are adamant that Kenneth Macleod's business philosophy was well-constructed and they are determined that continuity will prevail. Collectively they have more than 30 years' service with the company and more than 60 years' experience in the travel trade. Simon Gemmell will remain at the company's Greenock office, similarly Julian Stark will continue at Bothwell Street, Glasgow where much business-orientated travel is handled. New premises have been acquired at Shawlands and a new office has been opened at Giffnock. Elaine Tait is in overall charge of the Shawlands and Giffnock branches and will divide her time between them. ''At Giffnock we found an office that had character and an off-street location. It also covered Mearns and Giffnock where we have a lot of clients. Coincidentally we acquired good premises in Shawlands,'' said Elaine. The new office manager at Giffnock is Shona Hardcastle, who has a wealth of experience in the travel business and was assistant manager at Bothwell Street for a number of years; Heather Mitchell is in charge of the new office at Shawlands and has 12 years' travel experience originally working with Elaine Tait in Bothwell Street. ''On the holiday side we do try to know where we are sending our customers. We don't just sell anything and generally know quite a bit about different hotels and apartments and advise people accordingly. If we don't know about a place we will find out more either through tourist offices or perhaps by getting videos of a location,'' said Simon Gemmell. This thinking was echoed by Elaine Tait: ''Many people don't want to go to a travel agent just to see what an assistant will find on a Viewdata terminal. Our service may involve a two or three-hour interview to discuss exactly what a person's likes or dislikes are so that we may match the correct holiday to them.'' Although there are different segments in the market such as the inclusive packaged tour or the ''friends and relatives'' market -- Australia, New Zealand, Canada, or even round the world travel -- Kenneth Macleod Travel has in its offices the latest technology that will provide information on scheduled flights. For the traveller who knows where he wants to go but is unsure of connections, costs or availability, the computer Galileo will come to the rescue. Julian Stark summarised its capabilities: ''All the airlines and their computers use different languages but put information into a central core. It is from this central core that Galileo draws valid statistics from airlines. ''We can look at the itineraries in the machine and see what the best route is and issue tickets right down to the seat number and whether smoking/non-smoking, aisle or inside seat is required. We are also able to find the best fares, not only from the airlines but from consolidators who are really wholesalers for airline tickets.'' The company is also keen to learn about clients' holidays and, more important, if there had been problems or if things hadn't gone smoothly. ''It is our policy to send postcards to our clients inviting them to tell us of any problems they had faced but with our high level of return custom we find out about most places and clients' holidays anyway. We do also try to get the best accommodation from tour operators and to satisfy customers' special requests. We are in a better position to act for our clients when we feel there may be problems but much of this work is done without the customer knowing about it,'' said Julian. Despite their being at director level Elaine, Simon and Julian are all very much on the ''shop floor'' of the business and consider themselves lucky to have an excellent staff who have remained loyal and enjoy being ''part of the team''. The company is well-pleased with its achievements in developing business associated with escorted groups. Recently such groups have had itineraries embracing Caribbean cruises, Alaska, New York, Bermuda, and the Panama Canal. By having a competent escort at hand clients are guaranteed a hassle-free holiday, an advantage reiterated by contented customers. The directors wish to see this side of the firm's business continue to expand and many of the company's senior staff are already involved with this service. This year the company has made arrangements to take groups to the Mediterranean, Caribbean, Alaska, Madrid, and the Far East. Kenneth Macleod Travel has certainly been built on solid foundations placing a high priority on personal service. And with its directors determined to continue this business philosophy it would appear they are three people with the world in the palm of their hands.

Tenant farmers in the Black Isle have enlisted the help of the Ross, Cromarty and Skye MP, Mr Charles Kennedy, to raise in Parliament the issue of rent increases and arbitration costs. Members of the Black Isle Tenant Farmers' Action Group on the Rosehaugh and Kilcoy estates claim that they face increases of up to 150% proposed by the landowner, Broadland Properties, a Scarborough-based property investment company who bought the farms four years ago. One tenant farmer, who opposed the rent increases, has now incurred legal, arbitration, and professional advice costs in the region of #30,000. Any further appeal to the Land Court could double that sum. After a meeting with the farmers, Mr Kennedy said that it was clear that the costs of arbitration were now way above anything which Parliament intended when legislation was passed in 1991. ''I hope that the Parliamentary answers to me, will give us a well-informed base from which to argue some practical improvements to the arbitration system, which could be implemented by Ministers,'' he said. The most recent policy statement from his party, the Liberal Democrats, had already expressed concern about the costs, and income position, of farmers. ''Clearly, huge arbitration fees are bound to add to an already difficult situation.'' The Rosehaugh and Kilcoy estates include about 25 tenanted farms, with rents varying from #1000 to #20,000 a year. They are mostly mixed farms, without hill ground. The action group claim that as rents fall due for review every three years, Broadland Properties are demanding increases of up to 150%, and refusing to negotiate reductions to a level acceptable to the farmers, making it necessary to go to arbitration. The farmers' experience has been that arbitration costs can run to tens of thousands of pounds -- far exceeding any reductions in rent which may be achieved by arbitration. In one case, an initial demand for an 87% increase was reduced to 76% in negotiation, and further reduced to 65% in arbitration. The saving in rent, however, was only a fraction of the costs incurred. ''Arbitration was always intended to be a cheap way of determining a fair rent, but it is now being used, due to the costs involved, as a stick to break the tenant's back,'' said one farmer. Mr Colin High, secretary of the action group, said: ''Broadland Properties appear to have been using the system to jack up rents. When farmers decide to oppose the increases, they feel they have to employ expert witnesses, solicitors, and Queen's Counsel, to match Broadland -- or accept out-of-court agreements to excessive rent increases.'' The farmers also complain that Broadlands have been quoting up to 12 farms as ''comparables,'' thereby increasing the costs of arbitration. The farmers involved say they are making only average incomes of about #15,000 a year. Broadland Properties yesterday referred inquiries to the Edinburgh office of the chartered surveyors, Cluttons, who act as their land agents. Mr Michael Thomson, who acts as estate factor, said that the basis for rent increases arrived at by arbitration, was comparison with other recent open market lettings. Both landlord and tenant had the opportunity to put forward the names of other properties on which comparison could be based. Broadland Properties also acquired part of the Rothes Estate last autumn from the Eagle Star insurance company, including 14,000 acres of forestry, farms, and grouse moors. Their plan is to retain the bulk of the land as a forestry enterprise, and some of the peripheral land is being sold off, including some tenanted farms. A spokesman for John Clegg and Co, who acted for Broadland in the acquisition, said that a number of tenant farmers were prosepctive purchasers, and negotiations were at a delicate stage.

JASON Gallian fired the first shots in his campaign to catch up with the Australian cricket stars he once captained. Playing for England A in Madras, Gallian secured his place in this weekend's first Test against India A by scoring 79 against a Board President's XI. Shane Warne, Michael Bevan, Justin Langer, and Damien Martyn -- plus England's other ''Aussie'' Craig White -- played under Gallian when he led Australia Under-19s in 1989-90. But having been born to Lancastrian parents, albeit in Sydney, Gallian decided he wanted to play for Lancashire and become qualified for England. That four-year period ended last year. The desire to make up for lost time shone brightly in Gallian's concentration as he battled through five hours, 40 minutes, and 280 balls in England A's cause. His skill against spin may well be needed again today, with the President's team beginning the final day 227 runs ahead at 151 for two in their second innings after having dismissed England A for 247. He said: ''That innings must rank alongside the most important I have yet played in my career.In this match it was vital for me to get as much time at the crease as possible before the first Test with India A, and two of their spinners are playing in this game, so it was nice to have a long look at them.'' The 14-man India A squad for the series was announced in Madras yesterday, and contains four Test players, including captain Praveen Amre. The squad is: Praveen Amre (captain), Vikram Rathore, Jatinder Singh, Rahul Dravid, Saurav Ganguly, Shanshad Rizwan, Amol Muzumdar, Vijay Yadav (wicketkeeper), Rajesh Chauhan, Utpal Chatterjee, Sairav Bahutule, Abey Kuruvilla, Salil Ankola, Paras Mhambrey. Scores: Indian Board's President's XI 333 for six, decl, and 151 for two (S Ganguly 54 n.o., V Rathore 42, R Dravid 34 n.o.); England A 247 (J E R Gallian 79, N V Knight 41; K Singh 4-56; V Chatterjee 3-56).

SCOTS Ross Matheson ande Miles Maclagan bid for places in next week's Australian Open championships when they contest the first round of the qualifying event in Melbourne today. The three members of the Scottish LTA's full-time squad all made early exits in the qualifying event for the first leg of the Portuguese satellite circuit in Lisbon.  Aberdeen teenager Jason Barnett beat Frenchman Steve Erhaik 6-4, 6-2 before losing 6-3, 6-2 to Rene Heidbrink, of Germany, but Euan McGinn, from Inverness, lost his opening match 6-3, 6-2 to South African Bart Debayer. Oban's Andrew Smith withdrew injured.

SHARES in Howden Group, which had been rising strongly in recent weeks, fell yesterday after the Renfrew engineering company announced half-year results. There did not appear to be a great deal to disappoint in the figures, with Howden posting a steady 12% increase in pre-tax profits. The company, which reiterated its policy of growth through acquisition, raised its dividend by 8.5% to 0.89p. Acquisitions are more likely to be within either Howden's air and gas handling or processing and packaging equipment sectors, rather than in the aerospace or construction and mining equipment areas. Director of corporate services Alan Maclachlan, who said the figures represented ''good, steady progress'', believed the 5p fall in the share price to 89p was not necessarily caused by any great disappointment with the results. He said: ''I understand we have significantly outperformed the market in the past four to six weeks and I am told by the gurus that the fall is by way mainly of a market correction.'' Howden's profits for the six months to October 31 rose to #10.6m, with its industrial fan and aerospace businesses putting in a strong showing in the US. Acquisitions costing #13m during the period, including military environmental control system company FCD and South Africa-based fan manufacturer Donkin, contributed #771,000 to operating profits. Order intake totalling #193m was up 13% on the first six months of last year and included the supply of equipment to French and Chinese power stations. With Howden tending to earn the lion's share of its profits in the second-half, Allied Provincial Securities analyst Clive Thomson is forecasting annual profits of about #31m and a total dividend of 2.65p. Last year, Howden made profits of #27.6m and paid a total dividend of 2.43p. He thought the market had perhaps been slightly disappointed that interim pre-tax profits had not been #500,000 higher, but believed the results laid a firm foundation for Howden. Earnings per share rose by 14% to 2.5p.

Does the Tempra live up to its name? Ross Finlay reports IT is usually Far Eastern manufacturers who explain their model names and badge designs in terms which a Zen philosopher would approve. When the Fiat Tempra was introduced, the Italians showed they could play that game too. Its name was chosen ''to convey an image of a strong, efficient temperament, while encapsulating the solidity of its content and personality''. Some people thought that was rather over the top, since the Tempra is essentially a Tipo with a four-door saloon or estate car body, but the description is quite fair for what is an often under-regarded car. The hatchback Tipo is noted for wide bodywork, in comparison with its overall length, and for sitting four-square on the road. With the added feature of a larger luggage boot, the Tempra shares those attributes. While many manufacturers just slap on an angular rear section when they convert a hatchback into an estate, Fiat has managed to give the Tempra estate -- or SW for station wagon -- quite a stylish rear, keeping that straight side-window bottom line which makes all the difference to the look of any estate design. I was driving a turbo diesel version, which at #13,096 is one from the top of the SW range. The entry level model is the unblown diesel at #11,149. Their load carrying features are efficient and practical. Width and height of the load area are among the class leaders, the rear door opens high and, while the floor covering is ribbed, so are the backs of the two-piece rear seats. When you fold them forward there is a completely flat floor which protects the carpeting from being scuffed or damaged by sharp-edged cargo. Like the Tipo, the Tempra offers good passenger space in all directions within quite a compact body. Headroom and elbow room are much better than in many other cars in the class. Up front, the controls are well laid out, although the folding centre armrest which is attached to the driving seat will get in the way of some drivers' gear changing moves. Where this Fiat is quite different from the designs of other manufacturers is in the fascia layout. The instruments are, first of all, set back from a series of horizontal ledges. Secondly, they are almost all either digital or bar graph style. There was a great craze a few years ago for this kind of thing. But there had been virtually no market research. Customer resistance to changing from round dials with needles was so overwhelming that almost everybody reverted to the old type. The Tempra's displays are fortunately quite OK. Fiat's 1.9-litre turbocharged diesel engine is a sturdy performer, although not as quiet running as some of its French rivals. It peaks at 92bhp and offers a hearty 140lb ft of torque, all of which means a 0-60mph figure of about 12.5 seconds, a test track maximum around 110mph and good strong performance in the meaty mid-range of engine revs. Fuel consumption figures go from 61mpg at 56mph to 46mpg both at 75mph and on the urban cycle. The Tempra feels solid in construction, and it feels much the same on the road. The estate's suspension settings are firm, but this does not transfer into jerky ride quality. On a variety of bumpy back roads, and on an A-class road which for several miles is nothing more than a succession of humps, the Fiat's suspension movements and body control were first class. I cannot fathom why Fiat continues with the Tempra's weird front wiper system, which offers fast intermittent or fastish continuous wiping, with nothing in between. However, other details of the car -- good glass area and all-round visibility, standard roof rack rails, substantial safety features and far better anti-corrosion protection than Fiat used to offer -- make it competitive, both as a vehicle at rest and out on the open road.

ENGLAND'S brightest new star for years came crashing down to earth yesterday as the injury jinx struck again. Darren Gough, who has lit up a mostly dark winter, is unlikely to bowl another ball on this Ashes tour. But he has made such a big impact on and off the field over the past three months that England may ask him to remain with them right through to their February 8 departure day. ''Darren has a bubbly personality, he's good for morale, and I would be happy to see him stay around until we all go home,'' said captain Mike Atherton, after his team had overcome this latest blow to beat Australia in the World Series Cup. Gough will be examined by a specialist in Sydney today but a stress fracture of the left foot, near the base of his third toe, has little chance of healing before mid-February. ''A doctor who saw Darren today seems to think it will take between four and six weeks,'' said England physio Dave Roberts. ''With only 30 days of the tour left, that doesn't add up too well for him.'' Gough collapsed in agony after having run in to bowl his first ball at the start of Australia's innings. He was carried from the field, face contorted with pain, and taken to hospital, where an X-ray confirmed the worst. Only four days earlier, the 24-year-old Yorkshire fast bowler had complained of pain in exactly the same spot. ''A doctor and myself thought then that Darren might have a stress fracture so we sent him for a scan and an X-ray in Brisbane,'' said Roberts. ''They were both clear, but these things don't necessarily show up straight away.'' Gough bowled brilliantly against Zimbabwe on Saturday -- and batted explosively yesterday while making 45 off 49 deliveries. In three Tests Gough has taken 20 wickets -- including best figures of six for 49 in Sydney last week -- and has shown enough batting ability to suggest he can become a genuine all-rounder. Now, though, England must try to get by without him -- and, maybe, for their World Series Cup qualifying decider against Australia A in Sydney tomorrow, without Neil Fairbrother as well. Fairbrother, who joined the squad only last week, sprang his right shoulder when landing heavily yesterday as he made a diving stop in the field. ''It's like a partial dislocation,'' said Roberts. ''His arm has been put in a sling and we'll also have him examined by a specialist in Sydney.'' All-rounder Chris Lewis, who has just started playing club cricket in the Melbourne area, helped out yesterday by acting as a substitute fielder. Now he will become the twenty-first member of this winter's squad and travel to Sydney today. Angus Fraser had put the hint of a smile back on English faces yesterday with his second satisfying performance in five days. He relaunched his international career in Sydney last week by bowling Australia to the brink of defeat during an unforgettable third Test. And yesterday his four-wicket haul destroyed the old enemy's unbeaten World Series Cup record. When Gough was carried to the dressing room after breaking down before bowling a single delivery, captain Mike Atherton threw Fraser the new ball. By the time Fraser had finished his fifth over, Australia were in ruins at 19 for three. This 37-run victory does not guarantee England a place in next week's best-of-three WSC final. But it gives them a handy edge going into tomorrow's final qualifying-round match. They now lead Australia A by two points -- and can even afford to lose to them in Sydney by up to 27 runs. ''When Darren went off we were a bowler short and we all had to try to give a bit extra. Everyone did and I was delighted with the effort we put in. England's useful total of 225 for eight looked less impressive once Gough departed. His absence meant both Graham Gooch and Graeme Hick had to bowl 10 overs -- but, thanks to Fraser's crucial early burst, Australia were unable to take advantage. Australia launched a recovery through Mark Waugh and, later, Ian Healy. But man-of-the-match Hick removed both of them to clinch England's first victory of the winter against Taylor's team. Hick, supported by Fairbrother and then outscored by Gough, had made the most of escapes on 44 and 58 to hold the innings together until he was seventh out for 91. overall, England now appear more competitive than at any time since the first Test began in Brisbane on November 25.

SINCE 1991, Dollar Academy has spent in excess of #1.8m in new development aimed at improving the teaching facilities within the school, now in its 176th year. In 1991, a #1m custom-built music block was added -- alongside the superb main Playfair building, set at the foot of the Ochil Hills. The development provided an auditorium as well as classrooms and practice rooms, adding further potential to the outstanding music department. Dollar's latest project, explains Rector John Robertson, is a Language/Business/Computer centre due for completion in spring. At the end of last year the school's new Combined Cadet Force building was opened, for which it received a 50% grant towards its #170,000 cost, from TAVRA (Territorial Auxiliary and Volunteer Reserve Association). Over the past couple of years Dollar has spent #50,000 on its boarding houses.

ONE of Britain's most famous racing teams may be driven out of business by a #150,000 theft. BRM Cars, which were built exclusively in Lincolnshire and dominated the sport in the 1960s, have been hit by the theft of unique spare parts from the world's only remaining restoration workshop near Sleaford. Some of the sport's greatest names drove for BRM, including Graham Hill, who took the team to a world championship victory in 1962, and Stirling Moss.

ONE of the most noticeable changes in the independent schools sector today, is its ability to adapt to meet the changing needs of parents in a world which seems in a constant state of flux. Take the nursery schools, which many independent schools have incorporated within them. Against a background of ever-increasing numbers of women working, demand for places has seen an 8.27% rise in the past year. Most schools offer their nursery provision to children of three years upwards, but one member of SCIS in Aberdeen, accepts babies from three months, while some other will take little ones from two years and six months. In addition to providing a much-needed service for families, this innovation has enhanced the earning power of many schools. Alongside this, at the close of the school day, once lessons have finished some schools are offering after-school care for children whose parents are unable to collect them immediately after classes end. St Margaret's in Edinburgh -- following an innovative and successful summer play scheme last year -- introduced its After School Club at the start of the session. Located in a converted former junior boarding house, it operates until 6pm on weekday evenings, looking after children in a wide range of ages. At St Margaret's, a girls' day and boarding school which takes boys aged from three to eight, the principal, Miss Anne Mitchell says: ''It is totally flexible, and has very much a home environment; it's not an extension of school. The children choose what they want to do. If they're tired they can watch TV, play with computers or chat to one another. Others will do their prep or music practice.'' The house, Miss Mitchell explains, is a large old Victorian building. ''We've kept its big, homely, Victorian kitchen. When the children arrive, they get a hot snack. I go there a lot, the atmosphere is so nice. Every time I'm there, I hear a parent pleading with a child 'we must go now' as they are engrossed in what they are doing.'' Prior to Miss Mitchell's arrival in May, research had been carried out with a view to ascertaining what was needed in the sphere of after-school care, and what the school could provide. ''One of the facts discovered was that there is a 750-hour shortfall in the year between school hours and the working week,'' explains the principal. ''Nowadays, you must be relevant to today's working world, and I do feel that since we're a girls' school, we need to think very much about the needs of working mothers. ''I've noticed when I've been interviewing prospective parents, that their faces regularly light up when I tell them about this. It's a big problem for many people if they can't get away from work until 5.30pm. The club offers continued interaction with other children, and the parents of an only child have expressed delight at the chance of her getting more opportunity to be with other children.'' At St Margaret's, the After School Club -- so far open to non-pupils too, as well as boys who usually have sisters at the school -- has to be a real bargain, charged at just #2 per hour. The school will next look, says Anne Mitchell, towards the provision of after school care during the Easter and summer holidays. Park School in Glasgow, again a single sex school with 292 girls, is another exemplary case of a school casting an eye over the marketplace and recognising and meeting a need. They too provide after-school care, in this case called a ''Homework Class'' which is teacher-supervised and embraces Juniors 1-7. ''Usually,'' says Mrs Mollie Myatt, the headmistress, ''We have 15-20 children on average, but it is very flexible. It's been running for 18 months, but the idea began a couple of years ago, in the run-up to Christmas, when we thought of the idea of looking after the children after school, to let their mothers do Christmas shopping. It was so popular, we just extended it.'' Park, like St Margaret's, charges #2 per hour for the service which is restricted to its own pupils. At senior levels Mrs Myatt explains, the school has always had a facility for older girls to remain at school until 5.30pm, although this is not as closely supervised as the Homework Class. And, under consideration at the school at present, is the possibility of running a summer school during the holidays, another area in which Mrs Myatt believes there is a demand from parents.

CRASHING waves and volcanic eruptions mark the start of the Government's advertising campaign for the privatisation of its remaining 40% stake in the two electricity generating companies, National Power and Powergen. Argos, the catalogue shop operator, is among High Street outlets offering facilities for potential shareholders to register interest in the share offer. In the next couple of weeks, one million leaflets will be made available through Argos' network of 347 stores, detailing how customers can apply for registration with the Share Centre. Customers then have until mid-February to register with the Share Centre for further details. Should they then apply for shares, applicants will receive an Argos Premier Points card worth #5.00. Argos Premier Points can be used in full or part-payment for purchases made at Argos. Premier Points are currently available from 770 Mobil Petrol Stations. Trials are currently underway with other outlets such as Somerfield Stores and Odeon cinemas. This is the first time that shares in a privatisation issue have been marketed through a High Street retail chain. The share issue is in two parts: a UK retail offer through share shops and an international tender offer. At least 40% of the shares are to be offered to UK retail investors. In total about 130 firms, including banks, building societies and brokers are participating in the offer providing 11,000 High Street outlets for private investors to register. In Glasgow, share shops include Allied Provincial, Greig Middleton, Redmayne-Bentley and Stirling Hendry. Potential private investors have to apply for a package of shares made up of three National Power shares and two Powergen shares. There will be a deadline, as yet unknown, for registering interest in the offer. Those registering will receive a mini-prospectus and an application form. The Government is confident that share shops are a suitable vehicle for the retail offer given the one million applications for BT3 made through share shops. Most share shops are also acting as retail tender brokers in National Power and Powergen enabling private investors to obtain a higher share allocation than they may acheive in the UK public offer. Private investors in the international offer will have to pay the higher offer price and there will be a minimum investment of #3000. A discount on the international offer price will apply to investors in the UK public offer, the size of which will be disclosed at the launch of the UK public offer, sometime in mid-February. Previous privatisations such as BT3 have offered a 5-10% discount. The discount will result in lower first instalments. The minimum retail application is likely to be higher than in previous privatisations at between #300-#500. Payments will be in instalments, spread over three tax years, making the offer attractive to those seeking to transfer the shares into a Personal Equity Plan. Existing shareholders of National Power and Powergen will be contacted directly and given a personal shareholder number with which to subscribe for shares. However, they too will have to apply for shares on a registration form through a share shop. Special arrangements apply for employees of either of the two companies. BZW and Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bankers co-ordinating the global share issue are confident that there will be significant interest from small private investors in the UK as well as the large financial institutions both in the UK and in other major financial centres around the world. Both National Power and Powergen intend to buy-back some of their own shares. Although this will be at the same price as that pertaining in the international offer, they will receive a discount because they intend to pay for their entire shareholding in one instalment. At the time of the two companies' previous flotations in 1991, 1.9 million private individuals applied in the retail offer. Of the 1.6 million original shareholders, 625,000 remain, the majority having shares in both companies. These original investors have seen a big uplift in their original 175p investment. However, potential new investors ought to be aware of the potential political and regulatory clouds on the horizon. The pathfinder prospectus is published on January 30, with the close of the UK public offer scheduled for early March when share dealings commence. Yesterday, National Power shares gained 6p to 486p, while Powergen were quoted at 532p, a gain of 3p.

DOUBLE glazing can transform your home, especially if you choose replacement windows and doors which enhance the appearance of your property, while making it warmer and more secure. Double glazing should help reduce noise as well as heating bills; maintenance-free window frames save the cost and trouble of painting, and new tilt and turn windows take all the hard work out of window cleaning. Choosing replacement windows and doors is a major decision, and the first step is to select a reputable professional firm which offers a wide range of window styles, manufactured from top quality materials to the highest standards, and a fast and efficient installation service. There are many excellent double glazing companies, but consumers have encountered problems with some firms. High pressure sales techniques, inappropriate advice, lost deposits, and poor quality installations are relatively common. There have also been cases where the windows installed did not meet local building regulations, and worthless guarantees have left the householder to foot the bill for another set of replacement windows which do comply with planning requirements. Before calling in firms to provide a quotation, it is worth having some questions prepared that will help in the selection of a firm which will provide high quality replacement windows at value for money prices. Reputable firms will provide a detailed quotation, describing the installation and listing exactly what you are getting for your money. Be sure you know that the type of frame which is to be used satisfies planning requirements, and whether internal sills are included in the quotation. The type of frame should be specified, the locks which come as part of the package detailed -- and you should check that these provide adequate security, and find out whether they can be supplemented if necessary. Most modern PVC windows come with built-in locks -- adding your own may be unnecessary, and could invalidate any guarantee. Independent consumer magazine Which? completed a survey of window locks a few months ago, and point out that you won't see many DIY window locks for PVC windows in the shops, and could be wholly reliant on the security measures offered by the window manufacturer, and the standard of installation. Locking systems for PVC windows have improved dramatically in recent years, so check that the firm you choose to complete your installation is up to date. Sliding patio doors are particularly vulnerable. Some can be lifted out of the frame, so locks should be fitted to both the top and bottom of a sliding panel. Special devices can be fitted which go in the gap between the door panel and frame to prevent it being lifted out. It is estimated that in 60% of cases, burglars break in through windows at the back of the property -- and in three out of 10 burglaries the window is left conveniently open or unlocked. The Which? research team recommend that we ensure windows are fitted with good locks. ''You should make your property as unattractive a target to thieves as possible, and you need to prevent -- or at least delay -- an entry to your home. One of the simplest and most effective ways to do this is to fit good door and window locks. Few burglars are willing to smash a window and climb through broken glass. No lock will prevent a determined burglar getting in, but it acts as a deterrent and will delay entry time. Specialist professional replacement window companies will be aware of the security aspects, and able to provide a range of windows and doors which are fitted with reliable locks. Installing double glazing is a major home improvement, and banks and building societies provide loans to meet some or all of the cost. Most double glazing contractors ask for a deposit -- it is normal practice in the business and is acceptable so long as it does not exceed the 20% limit suggested by the Office of Fair Trading, but check that your deposit is protected if the contractor ceases trading before the job is completed. There are schemes backed by major insurance companies which provide protection to customers of double glazing firms, and some contractors are members of one of these schemes which protect deposits, back guarantees and will even meet the cost of remedial work in the event of a defect occurring, even if the contractor has gone out of business. Some firms expect payment on completion of the installation, but it is in your interests to arrange to have at least seven days to check that the new windows are properly installed and effective. Correct design, appropriate materials and professional installation are essential -- even the best quality windows will perform poorly if the installation is shoddy. Choose a reliable firm of careful contractors, and you will get full benefit from every penny you spend on new double glazed windows and doors, which will increase the comfort of your home, and cut your fuel bills.

NORTHERN Electric, fighting to fend off Cunard liners to construction group Trafalgar House's #1200m hostile bid, yesterday attacked both the terms of the offer and the motivation of Trafalgar in seeking to acquire the electricity distribution group. The company also sent a submission to electricity regulator Professor Stephen Littlechild, putting the case for the bid to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on the grounds that it raises issues of serious public concern. Northern says that Trafalgar's bid document contains no credible commercial rationale for the bid and implies that it is being undertaken primarily to avoid tax, estimated at approaching #300m. It says that the non-cash consideration in the offer is of uncertain value and is being issued by a company which, in the last four years, has been forced to return to the market on three separate occasions to raise over #900m. The electricity company claims that the acquisition of Northern Electric would bring to Trafalgar, about a quarter of whose shares are owned by Hongkong Land, the quality of earnings, cash flow and financial strength which it appears to lack; but it is difficult to see what Trafalgar would bring to Northern Electric. Northern's chairman David Morris comments acidly, ''Trafalgar House's claims to be able to encourage an increasingly commercial culture in Northern Electric while continuing to enhance the quality of service offered to customers, constrasts starkly with the recent debacle suffered by the QE2 passengers.'' He added that ''the rewards enjoyed by Northern's shareholders and customers from our commitment to high standards of efficiency, quality and service should not be jeopardised by the dictates of a financially challenged conglomerate, controlled by an offshore minority shareholder.'' In its wide ranging submission to the regulator, Northern emphasises that it is the first attempted takeover of a regional electricity company or any of the privatised utilities. It says that as natural monopolies, RECs have characteristics which go beyond the normal confines of a public company. ''The right time for authorities to form a view on the takeover of utilities and to lay down any necessary guidelines is now.'' says Northern. It says, ''the bid appears to be driven by the financial and fiscal engineering opportunities which the intended acquisition would afford to Trafalgar. The financial strengths of Northern will simply be applied to support a cash-hungry conglomerate.'' The company argues that bids driven by financial engineering pose particular problems which may be contrary to public interest. It says the industrial or commercial logic which is the foundation of mergers and acquisitions policy is lacking, while the public sector finances are deprived of revenue.

AN American nutritional study has confirmed that pork from genetically advanced breeding pigs from the National Pig Development Company in Yorkshire -- which also runs large pig production units at Old Meldrum, near Aberdeen -- is leaner than pork produced in the USA. The Sarah W Steadman Centre for Nutritional Studies, at the Duke University Medical School, North Carolina, found that NPD pork had a fat content, cut for cut, which was between 35% and 73% below non-NPD pork. The ratio of polyunsaturated fat to saturated fat was twice as good in NPD pork. ''This means that the nutritional profile of pork from NPD breeding pigs rivals any kind of meat, including chicken,'' said Mr Andrew Bateson, overseas general manager for the National Pig Development Company. Smithfield Carroll, who hold the NPD franchise in America, increased their pork sales by 20% last year.

SODEXHO of France has seized one of the plums of the British catering industry with the agreed purchase of Gardner Merchant for #730m including #180m of debt. It will form the world's largest catering group. Gardner, under chief executive Garry Hawkes and finance director Iain Carslaw, was the subject of a management buyout from Forte in December 1992 -- the hotels group still retains a 24.8% stake -- and was backed by CinVen and a consortium of banks including the Royal Bank of Scotland. It polished itself up in the summer months of last year for flotation with a possible value of about #750m. However, changing market conditions and approaches from trade purchasers led to the idea being placed on ice. Interested parties included Granada whose chief executive Gerry Robinson had been hired from Gardner's arch competitor Compass and so had an intimate knowledge and understanding of the Gardner businesses. Granada already has a catering arm Sutcliffe but that is comparatively insignificant when compared with Gardner's annualised turnover of around #1200m. Sodexho is one of the world's largest catering groups and looked at Gardner as a takeover possibility in 1992. It intends running the British company as a separate entity. Gardner employs 55,000 people worldwide in 20 countries with around 30,000 in the UK. In the half year to July, it achieved sales of #556m and pre-interest profits of #26.9m. Its Scottish operations include regional offices in Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Paisley. Gardner's Kelvin subsidiary supplies the North Sea oil industry and the armed services in the Falklands. The leisure division includes brand names such as Town and County and Ring and Brymer.

JEWELLERY chain Signet's recovery is firmly established, and is predicting annual results will comfortably beat the previous 12 months. The company, formerly known as Ratners, is forecasting #1.6m taxable profits for the year to the end of January before provisions are taken into account for the sale of Salisburys, the leather and handbag chain. In the previous year, the group incurred a pre-tax loss of #85.4m as it undertook a major restructuring, including closing all the Ratners shops in an effort to drive it back to profit. During the 11 months to the end of December, sales climbed by 3%. And in the important run-up to Christmas, sales on a like-for-like basis were also 3% up ''Given demanding trading conditions in both our markets, the expected increase in results for the year to January 28, 1995 signals further progress towards the achievement of the group's short and medium term trading objectives,'' chairman James McAdam said.

VOLUMES of trading in the foreign exchange market surged yesterday as several currencies came under severe pressure. Those countries with high budget deficits coupled with domestic political worries were in the firing line, namely Spain and Italy. Both the Spanish peseta and the Italian lira sank to new record lows prompting Spanish officials to deny rumours that the peseta was on the verge of leaving the ERM. Italy, was of course effectively ejected from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism along with the UK just over two years ago. Yesterday, Italian President Scalfaro resumed talks with political parties to resolve the country's government crisis. Sterling fell by 0.5 of a pfennig against the mark to 2.3991, but was steady on the weak dollar at 1.5584. The pound's trade weighted index lost 0.3 to 79.2.

THE battle to save the Athena retail chain from the corporate funeral pyre failed yesterday, with receivers Grant Thornton failing to attract an acceptable offer for the business. The closure of the High Street stores will result in the loss of 600 jobs, although efforts are continuing to sell the 30 franchised shops. There are four Athena franchises in Scotland, including the one in the St Enoch's Centre in Glasgow and Union Street, Aberdeen. All 157 stores across the country, selling greetings cards, toys and posters, are to cease trading immediately. The sale of the business was made more difficult by the fact that a number of landlords seized goods from the shops where they were owed money, as they are legally entitled to do. This forced the closure of 37 stores before today's decision to cease trading. Scott Barnes, a partner at Grant Thornton, said that the closure of the business ''was perhaps inevitable'' given the plethora of problems surrounding the company. Grant Thornton were called by Athena's parent company Pentos two weeks ago because of mounting losses in the group. The majority of the Athena outlets were unprofitable and deemed unlikely to become profitable after taking into account rebt payments. In the six months to July, Athena lost #5m and reportedly owed external creditors between #10m and #15m. The company was founded in the mid-1960s, with its first shop in Hampstead, north London, selling low-priced posters ranging from Botticelli's Birth of Venus, Che Guevara and the cheeky picture of a tennis player scratching her bottom. It made a profit of more than #500,000 by 1979. In the early 1980's, it joined Dillons bookstores and Rymans stationers in the Pentos group and new stores opened across the country including a total of 10 in Scotland. However, the new Athena outlets were often in prime but expensive High Street sites and at the same time its traditional customer base has declined. Pentos will hope that it can put the Athena experience behind it and concentrate on rebuilding profitability in the rest of the group.

BAXI Partnership has received overwhelming support from Barrhead Sanitaryware workers for its takeover plans but must still persuade small investors. The workers' co-operative, now based in Hillington, has struggled despite a loan of #450,000 from Baxi last year and the English company sees a complete takeover as the only solution. Its offer of 40p to Ordinary shareholders for their #1 shares has been accepted by 96% of those entitled to vote and by all of the preference shareholders, according to a statement released by Barrhead. But only 17% of non-voting Ordinary shareholders have so far agreed to the conditions and, under the complex rules of the co-operative, a minimum of 75% in all three share categories must be reached for any change of ownership to go ahead. Most of the 500 or so non-voting shareholders are local small investors who have backed the company with some of their savings. They are being urged by Sir Albert McQuarrie, a former Barrhead chairman, to reject the offer and to hold out for #1 at least. ''I can assure everyone that this will be our final offer and all the non-voting shareholders, who have until January 24th to accept, should take note of the overwhelming support we have from the workforce,'' Baxi chief executive Bryan Gray said. His view is supported by the Barrhead management and chief executive Ray Peedle said he felt that Sir Albert's intervention had merely confused many people. ''The Baxi deal is the only way forward,'' Mr Peedle said. Baxi has instructed its lawyers to ask the Securities Investment Board to investigate the actions of Sir Albert, who no longer owns any shares in Barrhead.

THE defectors at the top of Saatchi and Saatchi are bound by their contracts not to start a rival advertising agency for at least two years, the group claimed yesterday as it launched a damage limitation exercise. There has been much speculation that the top executives, Bill Muirhead, David Kershaw and Jeremy Sinclair, who quit on Monday, would join Maurice Saatchi and form a rival agency, taking their clients with them. However, a Saatchi spokesman said they would be held strictly to their contracts and put on ''gardening leave'' which would preclude them from working elsewhere. Mr Sinclair would have to work out his 12-month notice and he was bound not to solicit clients and staff for a further two years. Mr Kershaw was in a similar position but was bound for just one further year. Mr Muirhead would remain bound by the terms of his three-year contract, of which he has worked about nine months. Saatchi shares lost another 12p to 112p yesterday, valuing the group at #246m, though it insisted it was ''business as usual''. Chief executive Charlie Scott moved quickly to fill the vacuum at the top, promoting Alan Bishop to head up Saatchi &amp; Saatchi North America and bringing Michael Bungey, chief executive of Bates Worldwide and Ed Wax, head of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising Worldwide, on to the main board. Mr Scott himself has become acting chairman. Mr Scott commented: ''My job now is to ensure stability to clients and employees. Everybody in this agency was surprised at yesterday's resignations.'' The group urgently needs to reassure its clients who are getting distinctly restless, none more so than British Airways, whose account is worth #12m.

PICT Petroleum has bowed to the inevitable and recommended acceptance of a takeover bid from Premier Consolidated Oilfields valuing the company at #102m. Shareholders in the Edinburgh-registered company have been offered 31 new Premier shares for every four Pict shares. The all-paper deal is equivalent to a cash offer of 197p per Pict share, a valuation described by analysts as ''generous'' and unlikely to tempt any other bidders into the ring. Pict shares shot up to 192p on the announcement, though it should be remembered that before news of the likely takeover leaked out almost four weeks ago they stood at only 141p. They finally settled 31p higher on 188p. A offered premium of some 40% over the December 16 share price was enough to convince the board that resistance was futile. The fact that major shareholder, Amerada Hess, had agreed to sell its 48% stake to Premier was clearly another key factor. As part of the deal, Amerada Hess will pump #19.8m into the enlarged Premier group through the subscription of 60 million new shares to give it a quarter of Premier's total equity. Such a move makes sense to both companies as it allows Premier more cash for exploration and increases the geographical spread of US-based Amerada's operations. While the takeover looks fair in relative value terms, some analysts believe both companies are somewhat overvalued at the moment though -- as ever with oil companies -- much will depend on how much of the potential assets are realised over the long-term. Pict raised turnover in the year to June by 87% to #18m and operating profit by a similar proportion to #3.84m, helped by the early start-up of the Scott North Sea field. However, pre-tax profit fell to #3.3m from #4.8m, mainly because of a distortion from the previous year's foreign exchange windfall. Net debt has been cut by #3m to #9.7m, while the group cash balance remained stable at #14.3m. Aside from Scott and a few new fields, Pict's share in the Ivanhoe and Rob Roy fields has proved more lucrative than first estimates and cash flow looks comfortable for the next few years. For Premier itself, the purchase of Pict gives it greater access to the North Sea fields where the Scottish company concentrates operations. Premier's shares slipped 1p to close on 25p. Premier is headed by Barry Stephens, the chairman of the Siebe engineering and controls group. Pre-tax profit totalled #13m in 1993. ''We will be better placed to capitalise on existing development opportunities and so to confirm the enlarged group as a stronger force internationally,'' Mr Stephens said. John Lander and Sam Laidlaw, managing directors of Pict and Amerada Hess respectively, will join the Premier board.

LAST March, Kleinwort Benson's hotel industry guru Paul Slattery said the ''able'' Stakis management needed more hotels and casinos in order to get the shares to out-perform. Yesterday, after a 115% rise in pre-tax profits to #20.2m, his enthusiasm is even greater and he said the management team was ''doing intensely the right thing.'' Stakis in its current form represents a remarkable recovery from the near deathbed case of mid-1991 when losses of #45m were seen at the interim stage and debts had soared to #192m as recession hit a company too extended in its activity range. Company doctor Lewis Roberstson was called in as chairman. His most important decision was to appoint David Michels as chief executive. Yesterday, Sir Lewis ruminated that the Stakis turnround was the most satisfying of his career. The Michels' flair for marketing comes out strongly in the figures. The like-for-like occupancy rate has risen in the year to the beginning of October by 0.9% to 69.3%, the best by any hotel chain outside London while benefiting from a 4.7% rise in achieved room rate to #41.66. After allowing for acquisitions and a #1.3m clawback on local authority rate rebates, underlying hotel profits rose 12% and to a total of #24.6m on turnover of #94.2m. And very encouragingly, and perhaps of strategic importance, the first 13 weeks of the current year have seen a further increase in income to #43.01 which translates into a 9.8% improvement in the yield per room at #30.06 on occupancy of 69.9%. Understandably Stakis was being cautious at present. The increase in income could be a fairly short-term phenomenon. But if it is the beginning of a trend, as it may well be considering the general flatness of retail spending on durables, it points to consumers spending more on leisure -- there have already been strong indications in this direction from brewers such as Whitbread in their pub meal sales. However, Stakis currently has just three hotels in London -- the major UK hotel market -- out of a group total of 37 units with 4500 rooms. The ability to push prices ahead faster outside London is partly held back by about 8% of the UK hotel stock being up for sale at present. The banks are reluctant to do the sensible thing and take drastic action using bulldozers. However, there may be a crumb of comfort from Forte having already sold 23 of its 60 Heritage and 20 unbranded hotels put up for sale late last year but values are still coming back. The troubled Queens Moat Houses business hangs like a shadow over the British hotel sector. Half of Queens Moat's UK stock is pretty secondary stuff with less than 50 bedrooms in non-prime locations. Stakis is looking only for hotels with more than 100 bedrooms and is in a good position to capture more business and conference trade which is about half its turnover. However, the better QMH assets are the ones the stricken company is most reluctant to sell -- but Stakis expects to pick up some bargains. About #33.5m was spent on acquisitions last year on four properties but it is looking for larger opportunities. Sir Lewis has firmly ruled out diversification beyond hotels an casinos -- and also venturing into foreign parts. Sir Lewis retires in March and will be succeeded by current deputy chairman and former Clydesdale Bank chief executive Richard Cole-Hamilton. The 22 casinos increased their overall contribution by 15% to #12.5m on a like improvement in turnover to #51.7m. Stakis was initially hurt by the decision to introduce a #10 membership fee but benefited from a higher spending clientele shown by the #8 rise in spending per head to #126. That in the latest quarter has accelerated to #134, again underlining the rise in leisure expenditure. Its new #4.2m casino on the Broomielaw in Glasgow will be opened early next year and will represent an investment well above the industry average. There are hopes that the permitted introduction of two new games, Super Pan 9 and Casino Stud Poker, will increase interest. Revenue should benefit from the likely relaxation of the rules which will raise the number of gaming machines from two to six later this year. However, gearing on current form and before any significant purchases will rise this year from 28% to 40%. Although there are about #70m of bank facilities still available, any big deal could result in a rights isssue which would be welcomed by shareholders currently holding a share which at 85p is trading at 20 times historic earnings and about 17.7 times those probable for the current year on the basis of pre-tax profits advancing to #26m or so. Despite the #67m rights issue at 72p last March, funds would be needed partly to finance two hotel acquisitions. The dividend total has been raise 55% to 1.55p with a 0.9p final for a mere 2.2% yield. Until the big deal is done, Stakis shares are likely to do little in the market but they still represent a low-risk investment in the hospitality industry for the medium term.

GOVERNMENT plans to overhaul cash support for the jobless, designed to encourage them to actively look for work, came under fierce fire from senior Tories in the Commons last night. Former Minister Alan Howarth (Stratford-on-Avon) said during second reading debate on the Jobseekers' Bill that it would widen inequality and deepen poverty. He warned the Government of the danger of sliding to a landslide election defeat on the scale of the 1945 Conservative debacle. The Bill brings in a Jobseeker's Allowance to replace unemployment benefit and income support for those out of work. It also will cut entitlement to non-means tested benefit from one year to six months and reduce the amount of aid the jobless receive with mortgage repayments, as well as introducing a package of measures aimed at helping them find work. Employent Secretary Michael Portillo, opening the debate, insisted jobless people wanting to work have nothing to fear. However, Mr Howarth said: ''I am dismayed by the authoritarianism of this Bill. ''Are the unemployed to be treated as criminals? They are our fellow human beings and they ought to count on our sympathy and support. Are the poor so undeserving that they deserve this?'' Sir Ralph Howell (Norfolk North -- Con.) said there was ''something awful'' about insisting people should go on writing application letters when there was no work available. He added: ''The time has come when we should consider whether a Bill for the right to work should not be introduced.'' Earlier Mr Portillo told the House there was ''no God-given right for any person to decide to be idle and live off others'' The taxpayer had every right to expect those seeking work ''to do so with vigour''. Shadow Employment Secretary Harriet Harman warned: ''This Bill will not help reduce unemployment. What it will do is make those who are out of work, and even those in work, feel more insecure and more fearful.'' MPs later gave the Bill a second reading by 304 votes to 269, a Government majority of 35. Hot potato

THE Secretary of State was justifiably cautious when postponing a decision on the construction of a new Forth road bridge till the outcome of a public inquiry. For many, at least on the Lothian side of the bridge, it could be one too far for their liking. If Mr Lang's own preference is to have one, even that should not be taken too personally: in such matters ministers tend to speak for their civil servants, and in this case the Scottish Office, and its technical advisers, have made their own judgment in favour of an additional major road crossing on the lower reaches of the river. The findings of local opinion polls, and what is called anecdotal evidence, do seem hostile to the construction of another bridge, but there is little doubting the way in which the weight of traffic between Fife and Edinburgh has boomed in the last two decades. One important question to remember is how far this weight might be reduced by extra road provision, when it often looks as if new construction merely evokes the additional traffic it can carry. On that analysis any new provision for cars is simply congested itself within a relatively short time. The M25 motorway encircling London is often cited as a conspicuous example of this phenomenon. In fact another Forth road bridge might not just add to Edinburgh's congestion -- or shift its bottleneck half a mile or so -- for its location would allow traffic wishing to avoid the capital altogether to flow more fluently. Any public inquiry should, however, try to establish whether some part of the undoubted demand for easy movement which does exist might as well (and possibly more cheaply) be met by improving the rail commuter network from Fife to the capital. That network is extensive on paper, and its timetabling suggests a swift and convenient system of access. Users complain, however, that it is subject to an unusual degree of delay and that its rolling stock (a main source of interrupted journeys) is too old to perform adequately. One of the consequences of our considering transport policy in its separate categories -- road, rail, sea, and air -- is that little effort is made to consider all movement in one framework. Looking at all the categories simultaneously might suggest an integrated transport policy, but the Treasury is generally keen to pare costs to the minimum, and a bridge with all its new access roads might be far dearer than a re-equipped commuter rail network. At least the figures would be useful, though in this case the coming privatisation of the railway system may make assessments of future policy difficult. (It would not rule out the provision of public subsidies to rail companies if socially desirable but loss-making services were required -- the loss would have to be borne one way or another.) None of that even begins to consider the environmental arguments which an inquiry would air in the time between now and a General Election. That, and the time to do the actual building, would mean that any new bridge might have to await the millennium.

MR Tony Blair wants a serious debate on the reform of Clause 4 of the Labour Party's constitution. This is entirely reasonable, though from the tone adopted by his opponents inside the party and the more predictable opponents outside, his actions would appear to amount to either change by diktat or a revelation of the red ravening beast at the heart of socialist policies. Both interpretations are nonsense and deserve to be shown as such. For those within the Labour Party who want to retain Clause 4 in all its antique glory it has both practical and sentimental appeal. The values it encapsulates represent for many the very reasons which drew them to socialism in the first place. Mr Tony Benn believes that to reform Clause 4 would remove a historical perspective of great worth which has a role in informing current thinking. There is a measure of justification in both of these approaches but neither is strong enough to deter the cause of change. Clause 4 has historically wedded Labour to the common ownership of the means of production. Translated into modern language, this means the ability to take control of the levers of economic power, but to what end? Nationalisation is only one of the means available to a modern government to ensure a fair and equal distribution of the benefits of economic success. Mr Blair clearly believes that there are other routes to this destination. His reticence on the question of renationalising the rail service shows that he believes the fair and just management of the national economy is more important than the narrowest interpretations of how this might be achieved. Leaving aside the sentimentalists and the theorists, there are still those within the Labour Party who would like to rein back the modernising tendency. Although old Labour, in the form of the bulk of the unions, will probably enable new Labour to triumph at the special party conference in April, there remains the question of how much damage the argument will do to Labour's electoral chances. The Conservative Party is delighted at the opportunity to point to the persistence of a basic socialism at the heart of the Labour Party. Mr Jeremy Hanley is sometimes adept at making the best of a bad hand, but even he can hardly claim that the debate over Clause 4 amounts to a revelation of a dark and dangerous tendency in Labour. Whether he can play on the possibilities of internal rifts will depend on how Mr Blair's opponents conduct their campaign against the reform of the clause. It seems undeniable that some Labour energies will be taken up by the debate, but there is nothing wrong with even the most vigorous debate as long as it does not descend from debate to conflict. Most important of all in terms of electoral prospects will be the reaction of the public. At the moment it appears highly unlikely that Clause 4 will be an issue at the next General Election whenever it takes place. If Mr Blair's intended redraft of Clause 4 includes, as we are assured, references to opportunity, equality, fairness, justice, and democracy, and if Mr Blair puts in place policies which empower these words, the fate of the original Clause 4 will not be of the remotest public interest.

January 6. The continued efforts of Councillor Lally, the GDA, and their team of expert advisers to maintain Glasgow's position at the forefront of architectural, cultural, tourist, and economic excellence are undeniable. So why the collective council, tourist board, and GDA ambivalence toward the ''Tivoli Gardens'' plan for the derelict Garden Festival site? Councillor Lally is quoted as saying that the Clyde Festival Garden scheme ''would only last six months a year . . . '' Perhaps he needs reminding that it rains and gets cold in mainland Europe too. Our climate sustains many dear green places; glazed climate-controlled environments are also feasible. Instead of another architecturally ubiquitous science park comprising industrial units and a multiplex car-park/cinema, the Tivoli proposal could embrace the musical fountains of Salzburg, romance of Venice, popularity of Legoland, exuberance of Central Park, and style of Barcelona or Milan -- in Glasgow. The thematic garden, European cafe style, and artistic venue concept, incorporating educational and scientific incubator ''workshops'' accessible to the public, would be a focal point for city dwellers, visitors and prospective Scottish investors alike. The enterprise, public and privately funded, promises sustainable long-term employment. Whatever and whenever something emerges on the Garden Festival site, it is more than just Councillor Lally's or the GDA's civic reputation that are at stake.

January 5. The almost universal view is that education and training are the key to securing a dynamic and diverse economic future for the country. The argument can therefore reduce to the simple proposition that effective education and training adds significant value and flexibility to the economy. This being the case, why should those prepared to engage in personal effort through bettering their education and fitness for a changing workplace be placed in a situation of double jeopardy under both Labour and Tory plans for charging students through loans and debt imposition for the privilege of improving the country's economy? Perhaps Maria Fyfe as a Labour Scottish spokesperson could answer that question for the thousands of young, and not so young, people now contemplating or engaged in further education in Scotland. Or is education and training just another populist slogan for transient political advantage? Gavin Roberts, 209 Maryhill Road, Glasgow.

January 7. Stewart Whiteford, of the Scottish National Farmers Union, says ''an understanding gap'' has opened up between farmers and the public, and ''it's hard to know how to mobilise the meat-eating public on our side'' (January 4). As a meat-eater who believes in animal rights, I have a simple suggestion. Why not shorten and simplify the ''long and complex'' food-production chain? If meat were produced for local consumption, the welfare of stock in transit would cease to be an issue. If it were produced less intensively, worries over BSE and other diseases would cease to be an issue. And if it were produced from stock grazing in fields, unprincipled carnivores like myself would cease to feel guilty about eating meat. Many more people, including, I am sure, members of Compassion in World Farming, would eat meat again if these simple steps were taken. Is Mr Whiteford's memory really that short?

January 5. It was with very mixed emotions that I read the article by George Hume marking the 25th anniversary of the police murders in Alison Street, Glasgow (December 27). One of the victims, Detective Constable Angus MacLeod MacKenzie, was my only brother. Even today, the task of writing this letter is accompanied by a sense of undiminished grief as one recalls the sheer horror of the events as they were recounted for me by Ian Campbell and Andy Hyslop as he lay seriously injured in the Victoria Infirmary. George Hume's account is factual, reasonably accurate, and free from the speculative sensationalised content of other recent press coverage. Crucially, however, if my recollection of the events is correct, my brother was first to be shot, having received a glancing blow to the temple which caused him to lose consciousness, Andy Hyslop got the second shot, and Eddie Barnett the third which ultimately proved to be fatal. Hyslop, wounded but conscious, saw my brother begin to regain his senses and Wilson deliberately step over to him and fire the second fatal shot through the head at close range. After his unsuccessful attempt to twist the gun through the partially open bathroom door to shoot Constable Sellar, Wilson again turned his attention on Andy Hyslop and would also have given him a second shot. It was at this point that the gun apparently jammed, saving Hyslop's life and giving Ian Campbell his chance to tackle Wilson. When he was led away by the arresting officers Wilson had the audacity to ask them to tell June MacKenzie that he was sorry. My sister-in-law had herself been a former police officer and was known personally to Wilson. The facts clearly showed Wilson to have deliberately taken the lives of two young police officers and to have been willing to have murdered three more given the chance so as to ensure his escape with a few thousand pounds. He left two young women widowed, two little children fatherless, and Andy Hyslop crippled for life. My father went to his grave a broken man, never having recovered from the shock of these events. I recall having recently read the chilling provisional statistic that, since 1978, 36 police officers had lost their lives due to the use of firearms and over 200,000 had been injured. Although it is clear that a large majority of the public believe that capital punishment is the appropriate sentence for most cases of murder, Parliament continues to decree otherwise. That being so, we have the right to expect that a life sentence means precisely that, yet here we now have a man who, having escaped the just reward of his deeds, is beginning to contemplate full release, and if reports are to be believed is already enjoying periods of liberty to pursue a new career as an author.

January 7. Oh dear, you're at it again (Five for '95, January 6), reinforcing popular misconceptions about the forthcoming turn of the millennium. Of course the year 2000 is special, but it will mark the end of the current millennium, not the beginning of the next. If the latter were true, previous millenia would have started in 1000 AD and the fictitious year 0.

January 5, I was alarmed to read that adventure training adversely affects losers (January 4). To quote the report: ''Members of a team who 'win' might feel their egos had been enhanced and their abilities vindicated but many 'losers' felt they had failed and their sense of failure was likely to affect their future performance.'' In the light of these disturbing findings it seems only prudent to eliminate any activities which might identify winners and losers; for example, all sports, most statutory and higher education, qualifications, performance-based appraisals and promotion, the enterprise culture, free-market economy, etc. To decry competition simply because the losers don't feel good about it is to ignore the positive benefits that can accrue. The objective of training is learning, leading to changed behaviour. Being able to compare one's performance against others can provide valuable insights from which to learn and improve future performance. Effective adventure trainers ensure that learning, through constructive, honest evaluation is the priority rather than simply winning. Those who lost on the adventure training are likely to have won in the learning stakes. Philip Maughan, Director, Endeavour Scotland, Cross Street, Callander.

January 9. Ian Paul's plea for the SFA to allow the use of TV evidence in disciplinary cases, while well-argued, ignores the fact that there are thousands of games played every week which invoke the same passions experienced by the Premier League clubs but are never recorded by the cameras. Players involved in such games would therefore be denied the opportunity of having the benefit of TV evidence (assuming that the incident in question had actually been filmed). The SFA could improve the present situation by instructing referees to consult their linesmen more often when in doubt. In recent years the latter appear to have had their role restricted to the offside rule. John F Crawford, 74 Drumsmittal Road, North Kessock, Ross-shire.

January 10. I feel I must register my disappointment over Robin Cook's response to today's Guardian advertisement taken out by Labour MEPs supporting the retention of Clause 4. Presumably he has yet to develop the full range of diplomatic skills needed in his new position as Shadow Foreign Secretary. We can only hope that in time he will display a more competent grasp of his new brief than he has managed with this seemingly ambiguous statement of support for common ownership. He declares himself in favour of a full debate on this issue. Yet he decries a genuine attempt to inform newspaper-reading Labour Party members of the opinion held by the majority of their European Parliament representatives. He also claims that those defending the current wording are trying to deny party members the opportunity to debate the issues. Both the advert and statement clearly set out one well-supported body of opinion within the debate, which even offers the option of adding to, but not replacing, the original text. Robin would do well to remember that this debate was foisted upon us by the leadership of the party and the NEC -- it was not initiated by Labour MEPs or anyone else. The start of the debate was announced to the party and the nation at the same time during live broadcasts from our annual conference. The MEPs were not responsible for timetabling the special conference five months before our annual conference. That was a decision taken by the National Executive Committee of which he is a member. The MEPs' statement has been around since early November; it is an unfortunate indictment of the system that it has taken this advert in the national press to stimulate debate to this extent, but now it is upon us we welcome the opportunity to discuss the issues.

IT appears that we are to be deprived of the unique experience of comparing and contrasting the dramatisation of Jeff Torrington's Whitbread Prize-winning novel Swing Hammer, Swing by two of Scotland's foremost men of stage and screen. Peter McDougall, who needs no parenthetical explanation, has completed his adaptation of Jeff's great Glasgow novel for BBC Scotland TV drama. Giles Havergal, no parenthetical biog either, will bring the book to the stage of the Citizens' Theatre. Havergal's theatre version goes ahead, opening on March 10. But it appears that the McDougall film for TV has been abandoned because of lack of funds at BBC Scotland and/or a lack of enthusiasm for the project by the bosses at BBC London. McDougall, in his usual combative way, is trying to get the BBC to come clean on their plans for the project. He believes the project has been scrapped but the BBC are unwilling to admit it. He told the Diary: ''It is not a complaint from me or a feud. I don't want to appear like some drama queen but I would like to know what has happened to a script that took up a whole year of my life.'' The feud Peter is not having is with Andrea Calderwood, whom he famously described as a ''wee lassie'' on hearing of her appointment as BBC Scotland's head of drama. The lassie and the boy from Greenock appeared to be getting on very well. He is currently halfway through writing a commission from her for six thriller films featuring Billy Connolly. The reasons for the dumping of the McDougall adaptation of Torrington's book are lost in the labyrinthine complexities of BBC politics. One man who is sorry it is not going ahead is Jeff Torrington himself. He read the McDougall script and pronounced it: ''Inventive, with many chuckles introduced by Peter. I had a few quibbles but was very much looking forward to seeing it on the TV. ''Peter had created a good ending to the story, which I had left open. Giles Havergal is taking a different approach by simply taking a slice out of the book.'' Jeff added: ''I pity anybody trying to put my book into dramatic terms.'' Linwood's most famous author, having recovered from a spell of being not very well, is in the process of completing his new book. Typing of Double Carousel, a series of short stories on the motor car industry, is forging ahead as fast as his one-fingered typing will allow. Going down well DEPT of We're Really Sure This Venture Will Succeed, Honest: ALEX (short for Aberdeen to London Express) was an air link set up last year between Aberdeen and London. Unfortunately, the service crashed, financially but not literally, after only months in business. So why is someone at Furryboots City airport drinking champagne as a result of all this? Well, simply that when the Alex service started the awfy cautious folk at the aerodrome had a sweepstake as to how long it would stay in business, with a prize of a bottle of bubbly for the winner. Paging Rambo READERS of the sports pages of the Independent on Sunday, an English-based but far from the worst English-based, newspaper will have seen an article which asked whatever happened to Alan McInally, the former Celtic, Aston Villa, and Bayern Munich striker. ''I believe he incurred an injury and has had to give up the game. I wonder if anyone has any more information on him.'' Information-seekers need have looked no further than the front page of that very day's Sunday Mail. The huge headline read: ''Police dash after Rambo love split''. Rambo, as he is known, saw his private life on the front pages after an altercation of a domestic nature. Mr McInally, should the Independent scribe really want to know, has been starring of late as a football pundit on Scottish TV. Hence the tabloid interest in the minutiae of his private life. Hampden Hughie SO welcome to Paradise, Pierre van Hooijdonk, the 6ft 5in Dutch striker who must be the biggest Orangeman ever to play for Celtic. But we want to talk here today about his nickname.

Icelander Johannes Evaldsson was called Shuggie. Pole Darius Wdowczyk (500 points at Scrabble to you, sir) was called Shuggie. At least Hughie is more up-market, perhaps because Celtic are now based at the gentleman's club, Hampden.

MR MAJOR, a cricket enthusiast, must have been pleased to be able to get off the back foot occasionally in his first Commons exchanges since before Christmas with Labour's answer to Shane Warne, Tony Blair. Rather like the English batsmen Down Under, the attacking strokes were a bit rusty from disuse, but at least the Prime Minister swung the bat and had a go. He was urged on by Mr David Evans, MP for Welwyn Hatfield, one of the few Tory MPs one would not be surprised to see wielding a rattle on the football terraces. He was, in fact, a professional footballer and a club chairman. Mr Evans delivers his thoughts, which are usually of the back-to-extremely- basic variety, in a bellow which, despite the hair-raising nature of some of the views expressed, goes down surprisingly well. Labour mostly regard him as politically certifiable and either grin, shrug, shake their heads, catcall or pay no attention. He unleased a torrent of invective from which the words Clause 4, VAT on school fees and split up of the United Kingdom emerged, reminding us that it was not a very happy Christmas recess for Mr Blair and his troops. Mr Major drove rather feebly at this full toss and said Labour's policy making had been ''running into difficulties'', which was some way short either of a princely cover drive or withering invective. Having another go, he less than felicitously suggested that Mr Evans should not worry about Labour's difficulties -- ''You should lie back and enjoy it.'' Mr Blair, about to exit for a visit to Brussels and some comradely exchanges with the Labour MEPs who chose the day of his visit to kick him in the teeth, nonetheless had Mr Major defending hard. ''Through ticketing'' may not sound like a clarion call to arms but if travellers find, as Mr Blair surmised, that they might have to travel 50 miles to buy a rail ticket out of their own area of the privatised network, it could soon be. Mr Major, like a lot of his back benchers, seemed to sense this for he declared that no-one was more committed to through ticketing than he. The impact of this was, however, somewhat lost when he admitted that if the Rail Regulator his Government has set up decides to ignore ministerial ''guidance'' on this or any other matter in his sphere of competence, there is not much Ministers can do about it. Rather pettishly, though accurately, he complained that Ministers were criticised if they intervened or did not intervene. This missed the point that knowing when to intervene or not is part of the art -- or craft -- of government. As it was entirely in the Government's own hands, when it drafted the legislation on what powers it would surrender, it has been neatly skewered on its own petard. The Prime Minister, having kept these leg spinners out of his wicket with difficulty, Mr Colin Shepherd (Hereford -- Con.) offered a slow donkey drop by way of relief. His style is quite different from that of Mr Evans. He referred to ''the nasty old Labour Party'' rather as if reading from one of the simpler Enid Blyton tales. Mr Major, his eye now in, belted ''the quickest U-turn in history on school fees,'' to the boundary. A neat leg glance accompanied Labour's education spokesman not being told what the party's education policy was. Labour's plans for education were ''totally and utterly vindictive'' he said, lofting the ball to the boundary again. Mr George Kynoch (Kincardine and Deeside -- Con.) invited him to hit devolution out of the park. Mr Major, who has been practising this stroke, obliged. He said he fully understand why some Scots wanted devolution but they were just wrong. Such Scots are unlikely to applaud if he repeats the stroke north of the Border.

POTENTIAL rail operators should be denied franchises if they refused to offer tickets covering the whole network Labour leader Mr Tony Blair insisted yesterday. He was involved in sharp Commons exchanges with the Prime Minister, who insisted that he was committed to through ticketing. However, Mr Major was forced to admit that under the Government's own legislation it had no powers to order the Rail Regulator, Mr John Swift, to do anything and could only offer guidance. Mr Swift's proposal that only limited numbers of stations need sell tickets to all parts of the country has met widespread criticism and an assurance from Transport Secretary Dr Brian Mawhinney that Ministers want tickets to be widely available. The Regulator plans to publish today a consultation document seeking ideas to maintain or improve benefits in the network as a whole, including through- ticketing, after privatisation. A spokesman said many people did not realise the limitations on through ticketing under the presenty system , for example, with the 1200 unmanned BR stations. One suggestion believed to be being considered by the regulator is to make conductors on trains responsible for issuing tickets beyond the journey they are supervising. Mr Blair said: ''Any attempt by the Rail Regulator to cut through ticketing so that people might have to travel 50 miles in order to get a train ticket is utterly unacceptable.'' Mr Major insisted: ''We have repeatedly made clear our commitment to maintaining through-ticketing.'' He said this should continue to be available from ''a wide range of outlets.'' There were ''Ahs'' from Labour MPs when he added that the rail regualtor was by law independent although the Transport Secretary could give him guidance under the Railways Act. Mr Major said: ''The regulator would be bound to take account of such guidance but at this stage, prior to the issue of a consultation document, the question of guidance is entirely premature.'' Mr Blair said the Director of Franchising should be instructed to refuse a franchse to anyy of the 25 potential buyers of a railway operation who refused to maintain through ticketing. He warned that under privatisation the railways would show the same inflated salary increases as other privatised industries. He said Labour would campaign for privatisation to be halted, he said. The railways should be run as a proper , integrated public service. Mr Major retorted that if privatisation was so bad he wondered why Mr Blair refused to commit Labour to renationalising them if they came to power. After fifty years, no-one was satisfied with the railways as they were he claimed, to shouts of dissent from some Opposition MPs. Labour had opposed every single privatisation, he said, but they had turned out to be success stories. He cited British Airways, where Labour claimed privatisation would make it '' the pantomime horse of capitalismm'' but it had been turned into ''the most efficient airline in the world.'' Mr Major added: ''We will privatise the ralways and it will be a better service.''

THE director-general of the BBC, Mr John Birt, has confirmed that there will be a significant increase in network radio programmes made in Scotland and that its effect will be to ''reflect Scottish life and culture to the whole of the United Kingdom.'' Mr Birt's comments come in a letter to Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, dated November 2 last year, but released by the Scottish Office only last night. Mr Birt replied to a letter from Mr Lang, dated October 28, which dealt with decentralisation within the BBC. Mr Lang said he believed the Government's White Paper on the future of the BBC, published in July, represented a significant boost for broadcasting in Scotland. The commitments in the White Paper to produce a higher proportion of network programmes in Scotland represented a real opportunity for Scottish broadcasting. Mr Lang said: ''I place considerable importance on these commitments to decentralisation within the BBC. You will understand that I would wish to be sure that the important steps in this direction, heralded in the recent White Paper, will be fully implemented in the full spirit of what was intended. ''I hope you will be able to offer me reassurance that the BBC understands my anxieties and are determined to ensure that the spirit of the recommendations in the White Paper will indeed be implemented.'' Mr Birt, in his reply said: ''We, too, place great importance on the White Paper's commitments to produce a higher proportion of network programmes in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the English regions. ''They reflect, as you know, the BBC's own undertaking in the spring to ensure over a three-year period that a third of all network programmes are produced outside London and the South-east. ''You refer in particular to network radio. The commissioning round for 1995-96 is now near its end. Within the next few weeks, we will be able to announce the complete portfolio of network radio programmes to be made in Scotland for transmission next year.'' The release of the correspondence followed a question to Scottish Office Minister Sir Hector Monro from Liberal Democrat MP Robert Maclennan. Sir Hector said it was not the normal practice to make available correspondence between the Secretary of State and outside organisations, but added: ''Given the interest in the future of BBC production in Scotland and the nature of the correspondence, he has agreed to make an exception in this case.''

GOVERNMENT plans to overhaul cash support for the jobless, designed to encourage them to actively look for work, came under fierce fire from senior Tories in the Commons last night. Former Minister Alan Howarth (Stratford-on-Avon) said during second reading debate on the Jobseekers' Bill that it would widen inequality and deepen poverty. He warned the Government of the danger of sliding to a landslide election defeat on the scale of the 1945 Conservative debacle. Sir Ralph Howell (Norfolk North -- Con.) said there was ''something awful'' about insisting people should go on writing application letters when there was no work available. The Bill brings in a Jobseeker's Allowance to replace unemployment benefit and income support for those out of work. It will also cut entitlement to non-means tested benefit from one year to six months. Employent Secretary Michael Portillo, during the debate, insisted jobless people wanting to work had nothing to fear. However, Mr Howarth protested: ''This Bill widens inequality and deepens impoverishment.'' Shadow Employment Secretary Harriet Harman warned: ''This Bill will not help reduce unemployment. It will not put people back to work. What it will do is make those who are out of work, and even those in work, feel more insecure and more fearful.'' Hot potato13

THE Prime Minister said yesterday he fully understands why some Scots believe a tax-raising Assembly would be good for them, but added he passionately believes it is a mistaken judgment. He repeated his claim that devolution would see a cut in the high rate of investment that came to Scotland because of the higher taxes the Assembly could levy. Mr Major said businesses would ''uproot themselves'' to escape the high tax regime. He told the House that Labour still had no answer to the West Lothian question, which Mr Blair had appeared not to understand when questioned about it the previous day. Devolution would do enormous danger not just to Scotland and Wales but to the whole United Kingdom. The unanswered West Lothian question asks why Scottish MPs at Westminster should still be able to vote on policies like education and health for England when English MPs could no longer do so for Scotland. The Conservatives, aided by Labour difficulties over Clause 4 of the party constitution and a series of gaffes over education policy in England, believe that the Opposition has not taken fully into account the impact on the devolution plans for Scotland as they will affect England and think this will tell against the party south of the Border as the policy becomes better understood.

New York, Tuesday FORMER President Ronald Reagan, who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease, no longer recognises old friends and once referred to a set of books as ''trees'', his biographer said today. ''About six months ago, he stopped recognising me. Now I no longer recognise him,'' says Edmund Morris in the next issue of The New Yorker magazine. Describing a recent visit to Reagan, he writes: ''For all the willingness with which he showed me his framed photographs, his jelly bean jar and his view of the Hollywood Hills, I did not feel his presence beside me, only his absence.'' At one point, Morris commented on a display of lead soldiers on a shelf and Reagan said: ''He we we had to make space, uh move those trees.'' Mystified, Morris finally realised that Reagan was referring to a red-bound set of his own presidential papers which had been relegated to the shelf beneath the soldiers. Reagan, 84, announced in November that he had been diagnosed in the early stages of Alzheimer's, a degenerative neurological disease that leads to memory loss and disorientation. Morris, a historian, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1980 for writing The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt and became Reagan's biographer in 1985. His book on Reagan is due to be published next year.--AP.

Jerusalem, Tuesday JEWISH settlers in the occupied West Bank today claimed another hilltop site in a new expansion that Palestinian officials say could torpedo the Israel-PLO peace deal. Settlers uprooted olive trees, put up barbed wire and bulldozed earth on a hill between Elkana settlement and a Palestinian village north of Jerusalem, Israel Radio said. Israeli troops did not intervene, but later stopped Palestinians from climbing the hill. They arrested one Arab man who refused to turn back. Elkana headman Nissan Shlomianski conceded his community has no permit to build a new community and said they were only marking out the land for future use. ''Elkana lands have been taken time and again by Arabs. We've come up here to return the land to us,'' he said. Earlier today, Israeli soldiers prevented Jewish settlers from setting up a new enclave beside a main road in the West Bank where Palestinians killed a woman settler last week. The army said its men pushed aside a mobile home that settlers tried to put in place. Fourteen settlers were detained before order was restored. About 100,000 Jews live in settlements scattered among the one million Palestinians of the West Bank, which was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. Leaders of Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority running Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho say any new settlements could torpedo peace moves. Last week, under pressure from the PLO, Israel shifted work for a new settlement site from one hill to another closer to an existing Jewish community south of Jerusalem, but the move did not silence protest. Today, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin repeated Israel's claim to all of Jerusalem and said he would oppose a full Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank. He said the government would go on building housing for Israelis in Arab East Jerusalem, which Palestinians see as the capital of a future state. * Armed Palestinians briefly held up a bus carrying Israeli schoolchildren in the Gaza Strip today and allowed it to proceed only when Palestinian police intervened, Israeli security sources and Jewish settlers said. Settlers said six Palestinians dressed in civilian clothes blocked a road with their car near Netzarim Jewish settlement and tried to board the school bus by force. ''They cocked their guns and aimed them at the driver but he did not open the door,'' Gaza settler leader Zvi Hendel told Reuters. Another settler said she thought the gunmen were members of the Palestinian secret police. Palestinian police arrived on the scene and persuaded the gunmen to allow the bus to proceed, the security sources said. The Israeli army said only that Palestinian police blocked an intersection near Netzarim after an Israeli patrol tried to prevent them from overtaking a bus.--Reuter.

A SCOTTISH doctor at the centre of racial tensions in Zimbabwe over allegations that he negligently killed five blacks was found guilty yesterday of killing two of his patients. The court decided that 58-year-old anaesthetist Richard McGown, 58, caused the deaths of two patients by injecting them with high doses of morphine and through negligent post-operative care. He was acquitted of three other counts of culpable homicide. McGown had denied the charges when the case opened in the High Court last July. He will be sentenced today and faces a fine or jail sentence of up to seven years on each count. It is expected he will appeal. The case has become a cause celebre in Harare because of racist overtones, and it was feared there could have been riots or attacks against members of the small white community if a not guilty verdict was delivered on all counts. The charges against Dr McGown were first made in 1992 after a parliamentary committee said he had killed some patients between 1986 and 1992 while testing the side-effects of spine-injected higher morphine doses on black women and children. The prosecution said it had no evidence the doctor was experimenting when the five patients -- three blacks and two Zimbabweans of Greek and Asian origin -- died. But it said it could prove McGown used morphine doses that were larger than recommended and was generally negligent. McGown, who is free on bail, looked relaxed as Judge Paddington Garwe gave his verdict to a packed courtroom yesterday. He refused to talk to reporters afterwards. One of the convictions was for the death of a 20-month-old boy who died hours after a circumcision in which he was given a heavier than normal morphine dose and was discharged immediately after the operation. ''One expert witness said there is no school of thought that justifies this conduct and that it was most bizarre and unique. We agree with those remarks. This child should not have died if it was not for the negligence of the accused,'' Judge Garwe said. McGown was also convicted in the case of a teenage girl who the court said received inadequate care after a morphine dose. The court acquitted McGown on charges in which he was ''not solely to blame'' or the evidence was unconvincing. Judge Garwe said he had found McGown difficult and indifferent during the trial and his evidence ''in some instances highly improbable and unbelievable''. ''He was indifferent to the proceedings. While in the dock he was observed playing with a chain, eating a sweet and he denied he was doing any of that despite clear evidence,'' he said. The trial has heightened racial tensions in Zimbabwe, a country which has been held up as a model of the success of black majority rule. Some Western diplomats say they have been worried about the small white community of 90,000 in a country of 10.5 million because of the hysteria which has surrounded the case. Late last year members of the student community in Harare threatened to subject whites to epidural injections or amputations if ''an accurate and just'' judgment was not forthcoming in the case. Similar sentiments were carried in the pages of the People's Voice newspaper, which is the official paper of the Zanu party led by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe. Protesters carrying placards which read:''White racists go home'' were seen on the streets of Harare last week. McGown was born in India but grew up in Glasgow and studied medicine in Edinburgh. He went to live in Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, in the 1960s. In later years he could be seen driving around the wealthy suburb of Avondale in Harare in an open-topped red sports car. He practised at two hospitals in the area. Married, with three children, he has been described as a flamboyant character and often wore a tartan bonnet. His wife, Sheena, has consistently protested his innocence to the media. Many colleagues, deploring the hysteria surrounding the case, described him as a caring professional and one of the best in his field. ''Dr McGown was highly regarded in the local medical field. I personally considered him as one of the top experts in his field,'' one colleague told the court in testimony. In his own testimony, Dr McGown said he had dealt with some 50,000 patients of all races in a career spanning 26 years. He said he had started using using a now controversial technique of epidural morphine after a ''haunting experience'' with a child in pain. Prosecution lawyers tried to show that the technique of using epidural morphine was dangerous and had unique side-effects that needed strict post-operative monitoring. The trial, which lasted five weeks and was one of the longest in Zimbabwean history, made sensational headlines, with medical experts called in from across the world, drama over forged hospital medical records and claims, by the father of one of the dead patients, that doctors in Harare planned to assassinate him. The prosecution portrayed McGown as arrogant, rude and uncaring. Prosecutor Patrick Chinamasa said the doctor had embarked on his new method of epidural morphine in 1980 with little consultation with his colleagues or medical journals. ''His greatest weakness is that he is self-opinionated,'' said Mr Chinamasa. ''McGown believed fervently that experience was the only teacher.'' The defence said McGown was being tarred by ''armchair criticism.'' They said if he had erred, he had paid too much attention to pain relief and not enough to side-effects.

Grozny, Tuesday A CEASEFIRE declared by Russia in its breakaway Chechnya region collapsed amid renewed fighting in centre of Grozny today and Moscow acknowledged that the exercise had failed to achieve any positive results. Rebel fighters used the brief respite to reinforce their positions in the Chechen capital, and Russian troops resumed their attacks on the city. Fighting went on around separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev's presidential palace throughout the afternoon, witnesses said, and the shell-blackened building was hit several times. The Russian government press service said in a statement Moscow's appeal for Chechen forces to hand over their arms during the ceasefire ''has not been met with any kind of positive reaction''. A Chechen military official told the Russian news agency Interfax that the rebel republic's forces had no intention of downing arms. Chechen forces used the lull after the official start of the 48-hour truce at 8am (0500 GMT) today to pour men and arms into front-line positions. Reporters who crossed the Sunzha river bridge on foot saw Russian mortar bombs, artillery shells and rocket-propelled grenades landing in Freedom Square in front of Dudayev's palace. Heavy fighting flared north of the square in an area where the Chechens face Russian tanks and infantry. ''Both sides are resting now and soon there will be heavy fighting again,'' said 29-year-old Musa, a Chechen fighter helping his mother to evacuate her apartment. ''The Russians will have to destroy Grozny to beat us. We are killing so many of them. They want to go home. We have taken many prisoners,'' he said. In Moscow, Oleg Lobov, secretary of the powerful Security Council chaired by President Boris Yeltsin, told reporters Russian forces would press on with efforts to end resistance in Chechnya if rebel fighters did not agree to hand in their arms. He said the Chechen leadership would miss an ''historic opportunity'' if it ignored Moscow's demands. But Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin met representatives of the Chechen diaspora and said ending the bloodshed in the region remained his key task. He said a special group had been set up within the cabinet and a plan of action had been worked out ''to resolve the Chechen conflict without the use of force'', Interfax reported. But Chernomyrdin has no power to order an end to the military campaign which is run by the defence and interior ministries and the counter-intelligence service, directly answerable to Yeltsin. Russia's human rights commissioner, Sergei Kovalyov, returning to Grozny after a brief stay in Moscow, denounced the terms of the ceasefire. He said Moscow's statements amounted to no more than new ultimatums to Chechens to lay down their arms. The Kremlin, which sent troops into the region on December 11 to crush Chechnya's three-year-old drive for independence, called the ceasefire after several days of fierce artillery and mortar attacks on the presidential building in Grozny. A government statement issued during the night called on the Chechens ''to leave their positions and armour, lay down their weapons and free all people seized in hostilities''. The brutality of the Chechnya campaign, in which hundreds have been killed and thousands made homeless, has damaged President Yeltsin's authority, stained his democratic credentials and brought sharp criticism from his Western allies.--Reuter.

United Nations officials entered the Swiss air ambulance once it landed at Habbaniya airport near Baghdad to make sure it was not carrying any goods in breach of the UN embargo.

HAMBURG: Winter flood waters swept through the port area of the city of Hamburg yesterday, washing over cars, parkland and industrial sites. Police said a combination of high tide and winds of over 75 mph forced sea water to a height of up to 19ft above normal in the north German city.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair may well get his way on re-writing Clause 4 of the party's constitution -- but only with the help of union leaders he has been trying to distance from himself and the party. And despite all the talk of extending democracy through ''one member one vote'', he will be as reliant on trade union block votes eclipsing the more militant constituency delegates as were other Labour leaders in the past. At the same time trade union democracy is deliberately being by-passed by a blatant tactic of settling the Clause 4 issue at a special party conference in April rather than allowing the issue to be considered at individual union conferences. The big union conferences could not be relied upon to give Mr Blair the decision he wants, and this could not be risked, especially with the bulk of the constituencies apparently shaping up in support of the retention of Clause 4 which spells out Labour's traditional support for ''common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange''. With the union share of Labour party voting due to reduce from 70% to 50% as individual party membership grows -- triggered at 300,000, which was passed last month, the formula allows for a 1% reduction in union share and corresponding increase in constituency voting strength for each 10,000 additional members -- the anti-Clause 4 brigade feel time may be running out if the clause is to be ditched. The proximity of a General Election is another factor and one that will make opponents of the proposed changes more reluctant to rock the boat. None of the unions has yet officially declared its position; indeed, they are all consulting members in advance of the April special conference and, as yet, there is no final wording available -- other than a reference to a ''properly regulated private sector and public ownership where justified on grounds of efficiency and equity''. But of the big unions the General, Municipal and Boilermakers (about 12% of total vote), the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union (8.7%), USDAW, the shopworkers' union (4.8%), and MSF (3.7%) and Union of Communications Workers appear most likely to support Mr Blair. The positions of the largest affiliate, the Transport and General Workers' Union (14%) and the third biggest Unison (11.5%) are less clear, and if there is to be any real threat it will come from this quarter. TGWU general secretary Mr Bill Morris has been an outspoken critic of the Labour Party ''modernisers'' in the past but has kept his own counsel on Clause 4, pending the outcome of branch soundings. His executive committee tends to be somewhat to the left of him and might urge a firmer commitment to nationalisation. Former Unison deputy general secretary Tom Sawyer is the new Labour Party secretary but this does not necessarily mean his old union will toe the party line, especially as a small but growing number of its 1.3 million members are seeing their jobs being transferred or lost to the private sector. The Blair camp's brinkmanship already looks set to win the day, but as the final wording will not be decided until mid-March, there would still be scope for minor changes aimed at heading-off a meaningful challenge should one emerge before then. A number of the smaller left-wing unions are adamant in their support of Clause 4 and some, like the locomen's union Aslef, have it virtually built into their rule books. Rail unions generally fear that the Labour Party under Blair appears to be backing off from earlier pledges not only to fight rail privatisation but also to reverse it when restored to power. They maintain that Mr Blair's recent utterences fall some way short of those of the then-transport spokesman Frank Dobson who told last October's party conference that ''the next Labour government will reverse the break up and privatisation of the railways; we will bring the rail system back into public ownership and control''.

For Labour leader Tony Blair yesterday marked the end of the calm before the Clause 4 storm that was always to be expected. As 32 rebel MEPs put their names to a national-paper advertisement (right) attacking his plan to rewrite that contentious element of the party's constitution, the gloves were off and the stage set for most rigorous test so far of Blair's political skills. Below, Herald writers and Labour MEP Alex Falconer measure the extent of the challenge the leader has set himself IT was actually clause 3d of the fledgling constitution of the Labour movement that was essential to building a national political party -- and irrevocably socialist. The horrendous slaughter of the First World War had another 10 months to run when it was adopted. The principle of public ownership to thwart capitalist imperialism had been an inspiration for longer and it had always caused trouble. At the foundation conference on Labour Representation in February 1900, a certain James Macdonald of the Social Democratic Federation proposed ''the socialisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange''. But the trade unions might have been alienated and the motion was watered down -- the work, it is thought, of Keir Hardie whose Independent Labour Party went on to fierce public disputes with the Social Democratic Federation. Subsequent Labour Representation conferences fiddled with the idea until 1905 when a resolution succeeded committing the movement to the ultimate replacement of the competitive system of capitalism with a system of public ownership. The Labour Party was born the following year, and the year after that Keir Hardie was among those who prevented this resolution from becoming part of the Constitution. It took until 1918, and the drive of General Secretary Arthur Henderson and National Executive member Sidney Webb, to implant public ownership in the Constitution. In February, 1918, the Labour Party was pledged ''to secure for the producers by hand and by brain the full fruits of their industry and the most equitable distribution thereof that may be possible, upon the basis of the common ownership of the means, and the best attainable system of popular administration and control of each industry of service''. Thus read clause 3d of the Constitution. It was altered a bit -- ''means of production, distribution and exchange'' replaced ''means of production'' and ''producers'' became ''workers''. At the 1929 Party Conference the statement became Clause IV, para 4, and it has remained unaltered to this day. It is now to change if Labour leader Tony Blair has his way at a special conference on Clause IV in the spring. He sees change as vital to expression of his ''new look'' Labour Party. It is his belief that socialists have always spent too much time arguing about the principle without giving enough consideration to the practicalities. His immediate predecessors, Neil Kinnock and John Smith, avoided what they thought would be unnecessary confrontation. They let Clause IV lie as a sleeping dog, much like some piece of common law still on the Statute Book but utterly irrelevant for hundreds of years. They had no more intention than Blair does of renationalising industries (he refused to commit himself to deprivatising railways only last Monday). But he has decreed that if Labour is to get power again it ''must say what it means and mean what it says''. Mr Blair believes Clause IV is now a necessary confrontation that has to happen. He sprung it on his party conference last autumn, towards the end of his speech. He took care that nobody knew it was coming, excising the key words from the advance of his text. Since then, no doubt the sitting room of his Islington home has been littered with drafts and redrafts. In recent weeks opposition has been growing from what the Prime Minister calls the ''red underbelly'' of the Labour Party. Mr Blair's redefinition of socialism to something more akin to social democracy is unnerving whole segments of his party, not just 32 of his members of the European Parliament, who repeated in yesterday's Guardian the advertisement first used in Tribune last year. Quite what the Labour Party will produce this spring in this final attempt to make socialism relevant for the next General Election and beyond that into the next century, nobody can be sure. The process of consultation, the biggest ever in the party, continues. The mood of change appears to be unprecedented. Clause IV costs votes. Hugh Gaitskell thought so too. In the Fifties, Labour lost three consecutive elections and Gaitskell, the leader, launched a phase of self-examination. Despite the fact that Morgan Phillips, General Secretary of the Labour Party, issued a categorical statement that Labour would not nationalise 500 to 600 large firms, Labour was soundly beaten in the 1959 election. A few weeks after the defeat, he demanded a revision of the party's objectives as bedded in the Constitution. He wanted to abandon Clause IV. With Tony Crosland, he believed in diffuse ownership and that socialism could be achieved without sweeping nationalisation. He spoke of nationalisation ''as a means, not an end''. Then, the argument was about whether social and economic justice could be achieved without control of industry. Public ownership itself was not so much disputed. Gaitskell claimed that the Clause was not adequate to define socialist objectives. He told the Blackpool conference in November, 1959: ''I am sure that the Webbs (Sidney and Beatrice) and Arthur Henderson, who largely drafted this Constitution, would have been amazed and horrified had they thought their words were to be treated as sacrosanct 40 years later in utterly changed conditions.'' The unions, spearheaded by Frank Cousins of the TGWU, and a sizeable number of the rank and file, crushed Gaitskell, who managed only a statement of aims to go along with Clause IV. It included this: ''Common ownership takes varying forms, including state-owned industries and firms, producer and consumer co-operation, municipal ownership and public participation in private concerns''. The NEC was not prepared to back Gaitskell in more radical change, confining itself to the opinion that the statement was ''a valuable expression of the party's aims''. Even so, a third of the delegates wanted it scrapped. It is said that Gaitskell went about his task badly, not making it clear that he would accept a modified Clause IV. Now the mood of the Labour Party, hungry for power after what will be 17 years, is to leave no hostage to fortune. Blair has considerable union support to build on by the spring. Nobody can claim that they are not being consulted and informed. He is expected, therefore, to win. But there are those who regard Clause IV as an essential element of the socialist bible. They reckon the current 39% Labour lead in the polls opens up the possibility of actually implementing their article of faith. Others don't like Blair, did not vote for him, and they can use Clause IV to bring him down a peg or two. The rank and file will probably decide the issue on April 30. They need a cause to take to the doorsteps. Mr Blair had better give them one, and if not Clause IV -- what? His honeymoon period is ending and the Tories are waiting for the chance to pounce. They say there are two Labour parties, Mr Blair's and the real one. A defeat for Mr Blair on Clause IV for this reason would not just be a personal humiliation, it could presage a Tory revival. On Monday, Mr Blair reminded his party that ''there is no more important task'' than making Labour electable. On April 30, the party puts this to the test.

Washington, Tuesday. THE O J Simpson trial in Los Angeles is at last getting interesting. After six months of wrangling over the admissibility of forensic evidence, blood tests and the like, the court is now considering the evidence that Simpson regularly abused his wife during their 15 years together. The jury was sequestered yesterday, sent away to live in a hotel for the next few months to be preserved from the public reporting of the case. The defence team finally abandoned its attempt to have all the DNA evidence excluded, and now comes the case of the battered wife. The judge has to decide whether the evidence can be used by the prosecution. Nicole Simpson had photographs taken on one occasion, showing heavy bruises on her face and black eyes, and put the pictures in a safe deposit box. The box was drilled open after she was murdered, and the photographs discovered.

A MAN caused almost #50,000 worth of damage when he set fire to a house because his woman friend would not let him live there, Inverness Sheriff Court heard yesterday. Gordon Alexander, 35, started three fires in the house using a cigarette lighter. The woman he lived with had earlier told him he could not join her in her new home. Alexander, of Easter Curr Cottage, Dulnain Bridge, admitted wilfully setting fire to the woman's house in Cromdale, Grantown on Spey, while she was away on March 17 last year. He also admitted having a shotgun at the house without holding a firearms certificate, and having the loaded gun while he was at a public road nearby. He was put on probation for two years. The court heard that Alexander set fire to the house then phoned police, told them where he was, and waited there until they arrived. They found him smelling strongly of smoke and noticed his hands were black. Investigations later revealed that a shotgun kept in the house was missing, and Alexander admitted taking it with him then throwing it away by a roadside. The court heard that he told a woman police officer where to find it and to be careful because the gun was still loaded. He also told police he had fired the gun once at a video recorder in the living room before leaving. The blaze caused #35,000 worth of structural damage to the house and #12,000 worth of damage to contents.

A CAMPAIGN is being launched in Glasgow later today by Scotland's largest general unions to try to prevent the break up of Strathclyde Regional Council's catering organisation Catering Direct. Under local government reorganisation, the region will cease to exist in April 1996 and be replaced by 12 single-tier councils. The direct services organisation, which employs 8000 people, has so far won all the regional catering contracts put out to tender. GMB Scotland and T&amp;G Scotland are planning mass meetings, the first of which will be held at the City Halls in Glasgow later today. T&amp;G Scotland's Glasgow district secretary, Mr Sam Harty said: ''Our two unions' preferred option for Catering Direct is for it to remain under a joint committee of elected representatives from all the new authorities.''

GOVERNMENT proposals for fundamental reforms of the criminal justice system in Scotland were roundly criticised yesterday. An umbrella group, Standing Conference on Justice, which represents more than 30 legal, political, and voluntary organisations, said the Scottish Office legislation was seriously flawed and would lead to ''a departure from principle and justice''. The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill enters its committee stage in the House of Lords this week. A large number of amendments are likely to be tabled but the Government hopes it will be on the statute book within months. Mr Alan Miller, convener of the group, said yesterday that there was widespread concern throughout the legal profession and voluntary sector over much of the Bill's content. Its most controversial clauses would involve major changes to right of silence of the accused in court proceedings, giving the prosecution powers to ask incriminating questions at judicial examination, and to comment on the accused's silence at trial. Mr Miller said: ''Underlying the right to silence is the principle of the presumption of innocence, which has stood the test of time in Scotland and is recognised in international law. ''We challenge Lord Fraser to produce a scrap of evidence which justifies the violation of such a fundamental principle of Scots law . . . and we reaffirm our deep concern that these clauses threaten to create miscarriages of justice.'' It was widely accepted, he said, as preferable for a justice system to allow some guilty people to go free, rather than to convict one innocent person. The group also expressed concern at the existing inadequacies of the appeals procedure in Scotland and accused the Scottish Office of complacency in deferring any changes until next year at the earliest. Conference members called for additions to the Bill to take greater account of the needs of victims of crime. Ms Alison Paterson, of Victim Support Scotland, said there was no evidence that victims supported Lord McLuskey's plan to give them a direct say in the sentencing of offenders. However, most victims were in favour of clearer sentencing guidelines and wanted to see judges and sheriffs receive extra training in the effects of crime on victims. Mr Paul Langan, president of the Glasgow Bar Association, said the proposal for prosecution and defence lawyers to agree evidence in advance of a trial was unlikely to be possible in Glasgow, given the heavy workload burden already facing the city's procurator fiscal department. The Scottish National Party's deputy spokesman on legal affairs, Mr Hugh Matthews, QC, said Ministers were being both anti-Scottish and anti-democratic by beginning the Bill's progress in the Lords.

Washington, Tuesday NEWT Gingrich, the new Speaker of the House of Representatives, has fired his personal historian, Christina Jeffrey, a week after he hired her. The Democrats had exposed the fact that she had once argued that the Nazi viewpoint was not sufficiently stressed in a programme on the Holocaust. She protested today that she had been sacrificed unjustly, and reported that Gingrich knew all about her bizarre views when he hired her, and the episode will do him no good. She is an old friend of his, a professor at a small college in Georgia where he also sometimes taught. He said today that he still liked and admired her. She had been consulted by the Department of Education in 1986 on the merits of a proposed history programme called Facing History and Ourselves. It was intended to develop materials for schools to teach about the depths of evil that ordinary people might fall to under certain conditions, using the Holocaust and the Armenian massacres as examples. Mrs Jeffrey wrote: ''The Nazi point of view, however unpopular, is still a point of view and is not represented, nor is that of the Ku Klux Klan.''

PENSIONERS are to be given a pep talk before they travel as ambassadors to Aberdeen's twin cities, following embarrassing incidents on a recent trip to Clermont-Ferrand. One of the members of that trip was so ashamed by the behaviour of some of the party -- whose antics included calling their hosts ''bloody Froggies'' -- that she wrote to the manager of the hotel in which they stayed to apologise. Now, Aberdeen District Council, which sponsors the ''unforgettable holidays'', will tell the pensioners what is expected of them and to remember why they are there. Mrs Marjory Skinner was one of a party of 51 which set off by coach in October for a #260 11-day holiday in the French town. She thoroughly enjoyed the trip but felt prompted on her return to write to the manager of the Hotel Marmatol to assure him that not all Aberdonians were as bad-mannered and greedy as some in the party. The visit was planned to ''widen horizons, encourage international friendship, and enhance the image of the city overseas'' but some of the travellers were more interested in trying to provide lunch for themselves by smuggling out food from the breakfast buffet. Mrs Skinner, a sprightly 62-year-old who swims and plays tennis, and was one of the youngest in the party, found some of the itinerary exhausting and was also surprised at the lack of a courier. ''This council learns by its experiences. On this visit, the coach driver was also the courier, which proved unsatisfactory because the chap could not speak French,'' he said. ''I would emphasise that the large majority of people found this and previous excursions excellent value and, for many people, it is the best thing the council does throughout the year.'' He said it would be impossible to pick 50 or 100 people at random and expect everyone to be satisfied. ''It would be unfortunate if these excursions, which were one of the best uses of the Common Good Fund, were put in jeopardy because of a few incidents. Councillor Mike Hastie (Con) said the matter was of more concern than the committee were suggesting and that it was not just an isolated incident of a derogatory reference to the French. ''We are making excuses for an embarrassing situation,'' he said. ''These people embarrassed the city of Aberdeen.'' He opposed the sending of a courier because that made the trips official. Councillor Margaret Smith (Lab) said the trips were official whether the council liked it or not, and were they not official they would not be sitting discussing them. The committee agreed to the appointment of couriers for future trips and more in-depth briefings as recommended in the report.

IT is nonsense, of course, this notion that the Duchess of York is basically unsuited to being royal. If vulgarity has a home it surely resides at the same address as monarchy. The flagrant shine of all that clumsy jewellery, the fizzing colours of majestic dressing, and now these oil wells at the bottom of the garden . . . such attributes speak not of class but of a common kind of glamour. So when some old coot, who used to be the Queen's private secretary, proclaims to The Spectator that the separated wife of Prince Andrew is ''vulgar, vulgar, vulgar, and that is that . . . '' we are wrong to perceive this as the reason for marital collapse. After all, it was the very vulgarity of Sarah Ferguson with her worldly wink to the cameras in 1986 which seemed to secure her as the ideal mate. While the temperamentally uncertain Diana cowered beneath a schoolgirl fringe for her engagement photographs, the sexually experienced Fergie tore through the unmerry House of Windsor like a barmaid with a winning lottery ticket tucked into her cleavage. No, what Lord Charteris's remark betrays is that whatever else may be in decline in Britain it certainly isn't snobbery. Even so, this is the age of the upfront vulgarian, and from now on no other princess will ever go to the altar looking like a sacrificial lamb. That said, should insurrection be in the offing any subsequent presidency should have some honest earthiness wrapped around it. Significantly, the person most favoured for the job in the Guardian's recent poll is the Speaker of the House of Commons, Betty Boothroyd. Here is a name resounding with Yorkshire candour and vulgarity in the very best sense, meaning ''of the people'', and those who say Ms Boothroyd resembles an old-fashioned schoolmistress ignore her robust mirth. Madam Speaker, or maybe Madam President, belongs far more to that splendid genre of North Country landladies who deal with mutinous revellers by staring them straight in the eye and telling them they've nowt to bite on, then jovially shutting up shop. Vulgarity, though, often plays close to comedy and tragedy at one and the same time which is why it sits so well with monarchy anyway. But its greedy seizure of swank may suddenly explode like a raucous fart in any corner of delicate society. It was at last year's Lord Mayor's Banquet in London that the wonderfully vulgar war over the Downing Street diamonds broke out. A hapless Norma Major appeared wearing a piece of state treasure round her throat only to have the Baroness Thatcher, fluting with anger and no doubt still smarting with the loss of power, assert personal ownership. As a visiting dignitary had left the necklace at No 10 during her premiership this meant, she claimed, it was hers alone. What comic drama that raw little incident might have found in Alan Ayckbourn's hands, and there are echoes in it of an episode in the life of Lady Thatcher's old friend, the vulgarly triumphant Nancy Reagan. Some years into her husband's tenure at the White House the First Lady came under fire for dressing not too well but too freely. Designer pals, anxious to be showcased at social summits, showered Nancy with brazen finery which she chose to keep rather than return. ''What Mrs Reagan did was not against the Constitution,'' remembers a protocol buff, ''it was just in very bad taste.'' Betty Boothroyd, on the other hand, would wear state jewellery with splendid unpretentious relish. A stickler for tradition, she occasionally rents a tiara even now when events demand it. ''And the diamonds are real,'' she says. ''I always insist on that.'' Elsewhere, being hooked on dazzle mostly means being hooked on money, too, which is why the vulgarly wealthy never have enough of it. Hence Ivana Trump's divorce settlement, Fergie's Budgie contracts, and those obscenely hiked salaries for jumped-up chief executives in privatised utilities. But these days a craving for money can sometimes be satisfied by simply standing next to it at vulnerable moments in a fat cat's life. Hence the arrival of The Walker, vulgarian of the age. Well-fed, well-dressed, The Walker is a parasite who exploits his single state by offering himself as escort to poor little rich girls, women who have no husbands or husbands who have royally turned a cold shoulder, or are too civilised for all this incessant partying over pink champagne. The Walker possesses the flashy attentiveness of a gigolo even if he remains no more than an accompaniment, someone to take the bleak look off a woman stranded without romance. He flatters, he soothes, he listens in a shrewdly solicitous manner, ever careful to safeguard the confidences of his ladies until, perhaps, the time is perfect to take revenge with a ghost-written blockbusting memoir. In London, last autumn, James Hewitt turned The Walker into a skedaddling cad, but his kind is to be found in the glittering reaches of Paris, Rome, Monaco, Aspen, and especially New York where his presence as an arm-rest to the amorously betrayed seems to be written into every hefty alimony deal. Indeed New York must be the word capital of such ridiculous men, for lo, here he appears again and again, dancing attendance on all those near-embalmed beauties strolling out to uptown charity soirees, in the pages of Hello! But what is this? The paparazzi have spotted the calamity of the season: The Walker whose ingratiating manner has led him foolishly to choose the same fur coat as the one worn by his date. In the pictures floating over the newswires, the heiress greets him with a curled lip of contempt, and just at the edge of the snap there stands the vulgar gossip writer, eyes rolling heavenwards in an expression of cherubic malice.

POLICE were last night hunting a driver who left an elderly cyclist lying with severe head injuries after colliding with him while at the wheel of a stolen van. They used tracker dogs to search wooded countryside and set up checkpoints in an attempt to trace the driver, a man in his late twenties or early thirties. The incident happened in the grounds of the Duke of Buccleuch's Bowhill House estate near Selkirk. However, several hours later, as the cyclist was undergoing a brain scan at Edinburgh's Western General Hospital, the driver, who abandoned the van on the estate after the incident, had still not been found. A police spokesman said: ''His condition when he left Borders General was critical.' He said that they were still trying to identify the cyclist, understood to live alone not far from Bowhill. The van, a dark-blue Ford Escort belonging to the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, was stolen from outside a vet's surgery in Drumlanrig Square, Hawick, earlier in the day. The police spokesman stressed that it was not being pursued when the collision took place. ''We didn't know it was there at the time,'' he said. The man police are seeking was about 5ft 9in, had fair or greying hair, and wore dark clothing.

LOTHIAN Regional Council appeared likely last night to become the first part of Scotland to administer its own parking penalty schemes and keep the fines collected. Scottish Secretary Ian Lang said yesterday that there was provision, in the Road Traffic Act 1991, to let local authorities put forward arrangements to control parking in their own areas. As he announced measures to improve transport around the Forth estuary, he said there would be a new framework for parking in and around Scottish cities. Referring to traffic problems in Edinburgh, he said he would take steps to allow greater local responsibility to control parking and would view sympathetically proposals for such a scheme in the city. Dr George Hazel, Lothian Regional Council's director of transportation, said later: ''Local management of parking enforcement would give us much greater flexibility in managing transport in central Edinburgh and on the major radial roads. We are actively developing proposals on this at the moment.''

Brussels TWO Euro-MPs last night tried to force a change to European fishing policy in an attempt to head off threatened violence between British and Spanish fleets next year. Mr Robin Teverson, a Cornish Liberal Democrat, and Dr Allan Macartney (SNP, North East Scotland), asked the European Commissioner-designate for fishing, Mrs Emma Bonino, to support the idea of ''regionalising'' fishing in line with the EU principle of subsidiarity. Extending subsidiarity to the fishing grounds would, in effect, return the power to control fishing to EU member states at a time when British fishermen are increasingly calling for the UK's withdrawal from the EU's common fisheries policy (CFP). The British Government is the EU's strongest supporter of subsidiarity -- the Euro-jargon word for devolving power from Brussels wherever appropriate. But a change of policy would, in effect, mean yet another re-negotiation of Spain and Portugal's terms for accession to the CFP, even before they are put into operation on January 1 next year. Under the latest agreement, resolved just before Christmas to the dismay of UK Ministers, who abstained in the final vote, a limited number of Spanish and Portuguese boats will be permitted to fish inside the so-called Irish Box conservation area. The Iberians were granted entry in 1996 -- seven years ahead of schedule -- because they claimed they were not being offered as good a fishing deal as Norway when it was negotiating entry to the EU. Norway's voters rejected EU membership in November. Mrs Bonino, an Italian radical politician, was appearing before Euro-MPs in a congressional-style hearing yesterday in Brussels. She and other members of the incoming Commission will be ratified or rejected en bloc later this month in Strasbourg, at the Parliament's monthly plenary. British and Irish fishermen have predicted a violent confrontation in the Irish Box area next year when the Iberians arrive. The Box is fished by many boats from Scotland, mainly from the Clyde ports. Mr Teverson asked if Mrs Bonino would avert the EU fishing crisis by invoking the subsidiarity principle which Britain would certainly support if Ministers thought it possible. But the Commissioner-designate dodged a direct answer, stating only that limited catches and imposing quotas were not a long-term solution. ''We must whittle down the fishing industry,'' she said. ''It is not a welcome truth but it is a truth.'' Dr Macartney said Scotland had one third of the EU's fishing stocks in its waters but the threat came from areas like Galicia, which had about one quarter of the EU's total fishing fleet. He argued that applying subsidiarity to fishing policy would be the answer to the crisis. Urged to protect British salmon growers from Norwegian suppliers who have been accused of dumping stocks in the EU, Mrs Bonino said she might have to impose minimum prices on Norwegian salmon in times of crisis -- as last year.

THE grandson of the leader of the infamous Billy Boys' gang of the 1920s has become the first man to be caught by Glasgow's new security cameras. Glasgow District Court heard yesterday how the #1.lm city centre surveillance system videoed Billy Fullerton, 22, in an eight-minute running battle with another man outside a disco. Fullerton, of Ruby Street, Bridgeton, and Ian Brown, 22, of McIntosh Street, Dennistoun, denied breach of the peace, but after seeing the film of the fight in Mitchell Street Lane they admitted the charge. Fullerton, who also admitted a bail offence, was fined a total of #150 and Brown #75. A policewoman in Stewart Street Police Station saw the fight break out at 3.45am on November 20 and radioed for a patrol car to go to the scene.

A ROW over the name of the new Glasgow-based National Gallery of Scotland is emerging on the eve of the first public meeting of the trustees. Glasgow District Council's leader, Councillor Pat Lally, who plans to attend the meeting at Glasgow University tomorrow night, said he was unhappy with the current title, the National Gallery in Glasgow. ''It seems to indicate that it is some sort of branch office -- National Gallery of Scotland would suit me fine,'' he said. However, supporters of the Edinburgh-based galleries are unlikely to find the title of National Gallery of Scotland acceptable, as it would suggest that the best of Scottish art is housed in the new Glasgow gallery. Mr Mungo Campbell, project adviser to the National Galleries' trustees, said yesterday that the National Gallery in Glasgow was ''a working title which explains who we are and who we want to be, what the organisation involved is, and where the organisation intends this gallery to be''. The chairman of the trustees, Mr Angus Grossart, said: ''The danger of names is that they define the gallery. If there was an Andrew Carnegie around who gave us #30m, it would be the Andrew Carnegie Gallery.'' One of the issues discussed at the public meeting tomorrow, which will be chaired by Glasgow University's Principal Sir William Fraser, is the form of the gallery. Last month, the trustees outlined four options: a Musee d'Orsay style institution, combining 150 years of art with design, crafts, and other contemporary work; a smaller gallery displaying works by the greatest European artists on loan from the national collections in Edinburgh; a theatre gallery; and a photography gallery. Councillor Lally said it was important that the scale of the gallery should remain as originally envisaged by the trustees. A spokesman for Glasgow Development Agency said: ''We are working closely with the trustees of the National Galleries of Scotland to ensure that the new gallery is of the same quality, scale, and cohesion as they originally envisaged. ''We welcome the consultation process, which is working towards capturing the imagination and backing of the people of Scotland for the project.'' Mr Campbell said the public consultation period would last until the beginning of March, and that the trustees were also consulting special-interest groups. He said that from feedback to date, there was a distinctive leaning towards the first option. ''A lot of people are also in favour of various aspects of the other options,'' he added.

WHATEVER the outcome of the debate on the Labour Party's origins and their relevance to the future, one thing is certain: This is a rammy made in Scotland which will be settled by Scots. Quite aside from the prominence of Scots under the leadership of John Smith and the further modernisation drive of his successor Tony Blair, the debate on Clause 4 north of the Border began earlier, picked up pace sooner, and is already dominating the agenda about what the phrase New Labour means. Last year the complaint was common that, under Mr Blair, the party's origins and historic aspirations -- which had seen Labour continue to strike a chord with Scots voters -- were being changed in search of favour with electors in the South. The party's most staunch traditionalists could be found in Scotland, people such as MEP Alex Falconer (see right) and veteran organiser Jimmy Allison, who articulated the Clause 4 purists' case in the current issue of the Scottish Trade Union Review. ''I have canvassed all my life on behalf of the Labour Party,'' Mr Allison wrote, ''including the 1994 regional and European elections and the recent Monklands East Parliamentary by-election, and in no instance has Clause 4 ever been raised. ''Did some yuppie think we might win the next General Election because we changed our constitution? If they did, they are just insulting the awareness of the electorate. We will be judged on our competence or otherwise on how we would run the economy.'' An onslaught on party ''yuppies'' is more often the province of anarchic young militants than a veteran of the Keir Hardie House political machine. But Mr Allison and Mr Falconer were still regarded as being a step behind the debate yesterday. While many wish the Labour leadership had not taken the tin-opener to the can of worms marked Clause 4 at this time, it is widely felt that the debate must now run its course. But what might be termed the Left Realist response has also been more geared up in Scotland. The Campaign for Socialism, a purely Scottish body which mobilised early on in the debate, has worked hard both to draw a line on Clause 4 and to seek a compromise right up to that line. Mr Falconer is involved in drawing the line, others are seeking the compromise. The divisions now break down four ways, in positions which might be characterised as follows: * C4 -- Clause 4 purists who want to end the debate now and maintain the status quo, particularly Section 4, with its reference to public ownership. * C4 (plus) -- those who demand the retention of the existing Clause 4 but who would accept Blairite aspirations as additions. * C4 (principles) -- who would settle for a radical rewording which reflected the principles of the original, but would expect it to include support, however qualified, for the concept of common ownership. * C4 abolitionists -- whose new guiding principles for Labour would be so vague as to be unrecognisable to the original authors of the constitution. One of those on the Left of the party in Scotland who believes that the next four months can be more than merely a damage limitation exercise is Falkirk East MP Michael Connarty. He is working through the Campaign for Socialism to ensure that a solution is found which will get through into a composite motion before the Scottish Labour Conference at Inverness in March in a sufficiently tough-worded form to influence the subsequent replacement clause which emerges from Mr Blair's circle. ''The party leadership's aim is to arrive at something modern, non-threatening in tone, and containing no hostages to fortune in terms of the Tories and the press, but it is up to use to ensure that we end up with a wording that is firm in restating our belief in common ownership. ''That fact is that in the past it has been our use of Government power to combat naked market forces that has made us popular, not public ownership as such. ''My impression is that the words being spoken by some, such as 'let's leave Clause 4 alone and have no debate', do not reflect the debate that is going on. ''We are now involved in a debate which -- whether we agree with the timing -- ends up with something that is informed by the principles which informed Clause 4.'' 

GH950111-000104
THE Labour Party stands essentially for revolt against the inequality of circumstance that disgraces our civilisation. For those who support a new wording in the unproven hope of winning a few votes among the middle classes, Sidney Webb said in 1918: ''The Labour Party, which has never been formally restricted to manual-working wage-earners, is now to be publicly thrown open to all workers by hand or by brain.'' The declaration of the Party left it open to choose from time to time whatever forms of common ownership and whatever forms of popular administration and control of industry that might, in particular cases, commend themselves. We do not want a party that simply reflects the leader's wishes. This, after all, is characteristic of the worst examples of statism, such as the bureaucracy in the former USSR. In June 1994, David Frost asked Tony Blair whether he would seek to remove Clause 4 part 4 from the party constitution. The prospective leader said there were more important matters to be dealt with. In December, 1994, Frost asked Blair what had changed his mind between June and September. This is a question many members would also like to ask, but doubtless they would receive the same evasive answer. For the first time in many years CLPs, branches, trade unions, affiliated organisations and members must confront the real problems faced by an incoming Labour Government. Has the leadership realised that the more time that the party has to think, the more likely it is that their answers will reaffirm the need for common ownership? Because we will discuss the rationale behind our ideology, and examine our current policies, in the harsh light of changes in the global economy. Opponents of Clause 4 claim our present situation us vastly different to that prevailing in 1918. Yet our people still face economic and financial insecurity. We have millions of people unemployed, deregulation of working hours, wage cuts, and moves to reduce sickness and pension provision. The rich are still getting richer, and the poor still poorer. Do the modernisers not consider these significant? Labour's Objects says: ''We believe in an economy that works in the public interest. A competitive market economy, with a strong industrial and wealth generating base, is in the public interest. Yet it is this competitive market economy that has caused many of the problems above. All the former public utilities have shed labour, none more so than BT. Pension and insurance funds, whose #800bn assets should belong to, and be under the control of, workers and pensioners, are being invested overseas by unaccountable fund managers. Unfettered capital, new technology and free trade have created a political vacuum, which right wing and fascist parties are exploiting. Traditional right-wing parties are becoming more extreme, and the fascists more respectable. This rightward lurch threatens the democratic structures of western society. With Britain and much of the world in crisis, this is not the moment to jettison a powerful weapon for social and economic justice. Adherence to the principle of common ownership, and the democratic rights it bestows, provides us with the means to counteract the threat of the right. So what does common ownership mean to me? Firstly, I wish we had had it during the seventies when I along with my colleagues in Rosyth Dockyard were attempting to convince the 1974-79 Labour Government to give us the strong support to examine other outlets for our members' skills. Secondly, since being elected, I have been privileged to examine other systems of government in the EU. The one with the most advanced form of ''common ownership'' is, in my opinion, the federalisation system in Germany. Common ownership could mean that the #580bn in pension funds and the #210bn in insurance fund assets could become directly accountable to the workers whose contributions make up those assets. This would ensure that workers' savings are not used to pursue a policy of cutting people's water off and high salary increases to chief executives in the previous publicly-owned utilities. Common ownership of new technology could mean that the workers and the consumers benefited from its results. Instead of workers being thrown on the dole queue we could reach agreements on a shorter working life, without loss of earnings, thereby liberating people from dangerous and boring work. We should be under no illusion. The globalisation of capital, the use of new technology, and the many threats to our environment mean that we are facing the most crucial time in our history. Remember that those who deny or misrepresent history will repeat past mistakes.

Anchorage, Tuesday A MADDENED moose stomped an elderly man to death in front of bystanders on the University of Alaska Anchorage campus, authorities said today. Myong Chin Ra, 71, of Anchorage, died last night in a local hospital five hours after the attack. He had suffered internal injuries and multiple fractures. Witnesses to the attack reported students had been throwing snowballs and otherwise harassing the moose and its calf earlier in the day, said Brian Larson, a fish and wildlife protection officer with the Alaska State Troopers whose agency is investigating the incident. ''So the moose was somewhat agitated prior to the incident,'' Larson said. Ra was stomped repeatedly in the head and Larson said it would have been difficult to halt an attack by a full-grown moose. The wooded campus in Anchorage is frequented by many moose, but a spokeswoman said in her 12 years working there, no-one had ever been hurt on university grounds by one of the animals. There were no plans to destroy the animals, officials said.--Reuter.

Sarajevo, Tuesday INTERNATIONAL peace envoys plan a tour of former Yugoslavia tomorrow to help consolidate a fragile four-month ceasefire in Bosnia and press for an overall peace settlement to end the 33-month war. Diplomats of the so-called ''contact group'', comprising the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany, were to meet Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade to discuss ways of reviving a six-month-old peace plan. They intend to hold talks with Bosnian government leaders in Sarajevo before travelling to nearby Pale, the headquarters of the Bosnian Serb leadership. The envoys agreed on the trip after meeting in Paris where they heard a report from US assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke, who held tough talks with Bosnian government leaders earlier this week. In Washington, the State Department denied today that there were differences with the Bosnian government over the peace plan. Fresh reports of fighting in the Muslim enclave of Bihac in northwest Bosnia today demonstrated the difficulty facing the UN in making the republic-wide truce stick. UN officials reported artillery, mortar and small arms fire around the town of Velika Kladusa in the Bihac enclave, where fighting has erupted sporadically for the past few days. The UN commander in Bosnia, Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, had been due to meet the Krajina Serbs today to persuade them to stop fighting but their military leaders refused to attend. A less senior UN delegation will try to meet them in their stronghold of Knin tomorrow. The United Nations received one piece of good news today when Bosnian Serbs promised to reopen aid routes into Sarajevo, one of the conditions of the ceasefire.--Reuter.

OPPONENTS of the second Forth road bridge claimed a victory yesterday when Scottish Secretary Ian Lang announced that the plan was to go before a public inquiry. Mr Lang said it was still too soon to take a final decision but he believed a new crossing of the Firth of Forth would be necessary in the long term. The inquiry is expected to held in the middle of next year. His decision to have the plan fully examined, before it could proceed, was seen by its opponents as a retreat, in the face of widespread objections. Mr Alistair Darling, MP for Edinburgh Central, long an adversary of a second road bridge, claimed it was a major victory. He said Mr Lang, by conceding the bridge might be built in the long term, had effectively kicked the proposal into touch. ''I welcome the Government's climbdown, both in abandoning its original timetable and agreeing to hold a public inquiry.'' Mr Lang said a second road bridge was not a foregone conclusion. It was his view that such a bridge would be necessary. ''We are talking about a timescale that takes us 10 years from where we are today, and that has not been clearly understood in the past,'' he said. It is thought the bridge could be completed between 2003 and 2005, if it gets the go-ahead. Scottish Office officials are now to develop proposals for the crossing, and its links to the national road network, as a set of orders which will be discussed at the inquiry. The provisional cost of the new bridge and approach roads -- the subject of the inquiry -- was given as #300m by Mr Robert Irvine, head of the special projects division of the Scottish Office's roads directorate. Mr Lang meanwhile announced immediate measures to improve traffic conditions in Edinburgh and on the roads around the Forth. There are to be major improvements to the Newbridge and Halbeath junctions and the case for a Rosyth by-pass is to be examined as a priority. Officials would examine what peak-time tolling and automatic toll collection could do to combat congestion on the present road bridge. Mr Lang said he would approve Lothian Regional Council's ''greenways'' proposals -- which were meant to improve conditions on several key routes into Edinburgh -- subject to consultation on modifications he would propose. His measures represented a responsible and considered approach to the future of transport around the Forth, he said. A Scottish Office spokesman said studies of the transport system around the firth since 1992 had shown that conditions for travellers would deteriorate dramatically by the year 2010. There would be long delays at the Forth Road Bridge and key junctions, as well as severe overcrowding on train services. Mr Darling said it was essential that the inquiry looks at all the alternatives, including a Kincardine crossing and using the existing rail bridge by increasing rail links between Fife and the Lothians. Building a second road bridge would be an environmental disaster for Edinburgh, he claimed. ''The Government should know that any proposal to build another bridge would be fought tooth and nail through any inquiry,'' he said. Councillor Lesley Hinds, leader of Edinburgh District Council, was glad the Secretary of State had ''bowed to the inevitable''. Mrs Hinds said: ''It is the view of this council and the overwhelming majority of the people of Edinburgh that this issue should at least be properly examined.'' Councillor David Begg, chairman of Lothian Regional Council's transportation committee, said: ''It is the outcome we fought for and it shows that the Scottish Office has bowed to public pressure.'' Councillor Begg said his biggest reservation was that the so-called approval of the greenways was still hedged around with ifs and buts. Mr Terry Levinthal, for the Cockburn Association and the ForthRight Alliance, a group which is fighting the bridge project, said it was difficult not to be cynical, because Mr Lang would be judge and jury at the inquiry. What was needed was a planning inquiry commission, an independent body which would have the widest possible remit, he said. Councillor John MacDougall, leader of Fife Regional Council, said the capacity of the existing road bridge would be reached in a few years. The solution should include a second bridge and also new rail rolling stock. Mr Henry McLeish, Shadow Transport Minister, said the Government's timetable for the second crossing had gone adrift as Mr Lang was forced to confront the real issues involved. Mr Kevin Dunion, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, welcoming ''a victory for common sense'', said it was important the inquiry considered the bridge as a strategic crossing in a national context, not only as a local issue.

Brussels NEIL KINNOCK, European commissioner-designate for transport, waded into the debate on EU membership yesterday by supporting the principle of pooled sovereignty and rejecting the idea of the UK standing outside Europe shouting advice from the sidelines. Mr Kinnock made his debut -- generally regarded as impressive -- before the European Parliament where he was interrogated by Euro-MPs querying his policies and plans. His appointment must be confirmed or rejected along with the entire new European Commission by a plenary session in Strasbourg later this month. The former Labour leader showed himself cool on a referendum on Europe. ''In my view, it would be in some respects regrettable in a parliamentary democracy if we had to resort to a referendum,'' he said. If there had to be a referendum, it should concern only one question: do you want to stay in the European Union or do you want to leave? He said he supported economic and monetary union. Mr Kinnock argued that if the EU member states wanted to safeguard their various forms of sovereignty, that sovereignty had to be pooled.

THE nine Tory Euro-rebels deprived of the party Whip will demand to be considered for committee places as the price for their support in today's crucial Commons debate on the composition of committees. The rebels plan to tell the Government that if it wants their votes as Conservatives in the debate, it must treat them as Conservatives in the allocation of committee seats. They do not want a split that would deny the Government a majority on all the committees that process this year's legislation. However, they are trying to establish that they will not be banned from serving on these Bill committees. One said: ''If they want to treat us as Conservatives for this vote, they will have to give us an assurance that they will treat us as Conservatives in the consideration for appointments to committees.'' The rebels see it as an olive branch and proof that they are still Conservatives on broad policy. Their row is about Britain's future in Europe. The loss of nine MPs -- eight of them lost the whip as punishment and the ninth, Sir Richard Body resigned his in protest -- has left the Government with a technical minority, which Labour claims eliminates the Government's right to a majority on committees. Tthe Government argues that the nine MPs were elected as Conservatives and, therefore, continue to form part of its majority. A defeat in today's vote would be catastrophic for the Government. It would effectively hand over control of this year's legislation to the Opposition. * The Euro-measure which split the Tories last night completed its passage through Parliament. The European Communities (Finance) Bill, increasing Britain's European Union contributions, cleared the Lords without a vote, and now goes for Royal Assent.

A LAW student is suing the Scottish Secretary for #100,000 damages. Mr William Kermode, 29, is claiming in his legal action that his lifelong ambition to become a police officer ended after he was seriously injured during a keep-fit session at a training course at Tulliallan Police College, Fife. Mr Kermode told the Court of Session in Edinburgh yesterday that he was taking part in a relay race and injured his knee when he had to stop suddenly during a sprint in the college gymnasium. It was later found, after examination at Dundee Royal Infirmary, that his knee was dislocated. The knee was in plaster for five weeks, during which he continued his eight-week basic training course at Tulliallan in August 1990. He underwent a number of operations on his knee but was retired from the police force after doctors said that he was medically unfit because of his injury. Mr Kermode said his lifelong ambition had been to become a police officer. He had achieved excellent results in police examinations sat and was earning #15,000 as a probationary police officer. In October 1992, after his police career ended on medical advice, he became a law student at Edinburgh University. Mr Kermode, of St Giles Terrace, Dundee, claimed that, as a result of his injuries, he had also been forced to give up his sporting activities. He said that he had been an expert ice skater and had played ice hockey for 10 years with Dundee Rockets, who were Scottish and British Champions at the time. He was also a Dundee schools cross-country champion. He can no longer run or jog and was at one time assessed as 30% disabled. He blames the Scottish Secretary, who is responsible for the police force, for his loss, injury, and damage. He maintains that the instructors at the college on the day of the accident had not demonstrated the exercises which he had to carry out. He claimed that he was not instructed on the dangers of slowing down and stopping suddenly during a sprint. He claimed his injury was caused by the failure of instructors to give proper instructions during the circuit training session on August 10, 1990. The Scottish Secretary denies liability. The hearing, before Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, continues today.

A US airline is to buy 20 more Jetstream 41 aircraft to add to its fleet of 15 operating regional services from Washington. The latest order is a boost for the 2100 workers at Prestwick but management is still unable to give long-term assurances over employment. A deal has been signed with Atlantic Coast Airlines of Sterling, Virginia, which operates as United Express, for the delivery of 20 of the turbo-prop aircraft worth around #90m. The airline was the North American launch customer for the J41 in April 1993. The latest batch of planes will be delivered between the end of this month and mid-1997. ACA president Kerry Skeen, said: ''Since the introduction of the Jetstream 41 into our fleet, we have been extremely pleased with the aircraft's performance. The aircraft have proved to be both operationally reliable and very economical for our company.'' Mr Allan MacDonald, managing director of Jetstream Aircraft, said: ''Repeat orders are always immensely satisfying, since they endorse the success of the product in service. Following all our recent orders, this latest contract confirms that airline operators recognise Jetstream's leadership in the 30-seat regional airline market place.'' Orders and commitments for Jetstream 41 aircraft now total 129 worldwide and customers include airlines in Britain, the USA, South Africa, Korea, and Denmark. Cunninghame South MP Brian Donohoe said: ''This order, the latest in a series announced recently, is another vote of confidence in the workforce at Jetstream. It is good news and very welcome in this area.''

A SHERIFF'S sentence of 60 days for a bottle attack which left the victim permanently scarred was too lenient, three appeal court judges ruled yesterday. Nevertheless, they decided against imposing a higher sentence on James Bell, who has already served his sentence and is now working. Lord Hope, the Lord Justice General, said it would not be in the public interest to send Bell back to jail with the almost certain result that he would lose his job. Bell pleaded guilty at Glasgow Sheriff Court to assaulting Mr Robert McCreath at a public house in Kilmarnock Road, Glasgow, by striking him on the head with a bottle or similar instrument, and repeatedly striking him with a broken bottle. Bell punched Mr McCreath then struck him on the face with a bottle from which he was drinking and stabbed him in the stomach with the broken bottle. Bell, of Kilmuir Crescent, Arden, Glasgow, was sentenced to 60 days. The Lord Advocate appealed against the sentence on October 11, 1994, on the ground that the sentence did not reflect the gravity of the offence. The following day, October 12, Bell was released, having served half of his sentence. In her report to the Court of Criminal Appeal, temporary sheriff Margaret Gimblett, said the sentence took account of the fact that Bell had recently married, had a good work record, was appalled by what had happened, and had now become virtually teetotal. He had not reoffended since the date of the incident and was not likely to do so. Lord Hope, who heard the apeal with Lords Cullen and Cameron, said this was only the second case in which the Lord Advocate had exercised his new power to appeal against what he regarded as an unduly lenient sentence. In the previous case, Andrew McPhee, 19, from Drongan in Ayrshire, had his sentence increased from probation to three years' detention for supplying LSD to two schoolgirls. The issue in the present case was more difficult. The court had to decide whether a custodial sentence, which had already been served, was unduly lenient because the term of imprisonment was too short. The sheriff's sentence was plainly a lenient one, as she herself recognised, but the appeal court was not obliged to impose a more severe sentence, if it did not think it appropriate in all the circumstances. Lord Hope added: ''We have decided that the sentence of 60 days imprisonment was too low but that we should not interfere with it. It fell well below the range of sentences which would normally be regarded as appropriate for an offence of this kind.'' The sheriff had attached too much importance to Bell's personal circumstances and too little weight to the gravity of the offence and its circumstances. However, there were other circumstances which the appeal court had to take into account. ''These are that Bell has served his sentence, that he has obtained employment since his release, and that he has not reoffended. ''Since the date of his release, he has had the prospect of an increased sentence hanging over him which, in his case, would almost certainly mean his return to prison and the loss of his job.''

ARFUR, the London Zoo lion who mauled two men, both schizophrenics, who chose on separate occasions to climb into his enclosure, has been put down after a long illness. He had very little hope of recovery once it was discovered the extent of his disease. Arfur, a rare Asiatic lion, first became famous when Ben Silcock climbed into his area. Last year, Tony Samuri, also suffering from schizophrenia, followed suit. Both were mauled by Arfur, but each survived. Arfur was said to be a rather gentle lion unless anybody encroached on his area. He became ill in November and it was feared he would not see out the year. A post-mortem examination confirmed he was suffering from severe lung disease. It was caused by an extensive tumour. ''We are all very sad to loose Arfur and everyone will miss him greatly,'' Jo Gipps, the zoo's director said. ''When it became obvious that his condition was never going to improve, we thought it only fair and humane to put him down. ''There was nothing more that we could do for him and did not want him to suffer any further pain.''

GOLFERS keen to join one of the North-east's most exclusive clubs will have to pay to join the waiting list, a move which will net Deeside Golf Club thousand of pounds a year. The waiting time reputed to have been as long as 20 years but in a move to keep it at little more than half that time, prospective members will be charged a #5 annual fee. Club secretary Mr Alastair Macdonald says it has been hard to separate fact from fiction when it comes to the length of the waiting list but they have just reduced it by more than 200 by removing from the list those who did not respond with #5 to a letter sent out. Mr Macdonald said the waiting list policy had needed a review and a sub-committee was set up to examine the whole system. As a result, the waiting lists will be reopened on February 1. He said the #5 fee was an administrative one and that, if there was more than one family member on the list, only #5 would be charged. ''We are expecting a large influx of applications but none will be processed until a day or two after the February 1 opening date,'' said Mr Macdonald. ''The fairest method of dealing with the applications received up to that point will be to ballot them to determine their place on the waiting list.'' Even before the new applications are received, the men's waiting list stands at around 400 and the women's list is about 200. There is also a juniors' waiting list to which some youngsters have their names added at birth. Not a lot of people voluntarily give up their membership of the 92-year-old club in Aberdeen's Bieldside suburb. Those who may only be temporarily leaving the area usually ask to be added to a supplementary list so that they can be re-admitted if they return. The first year as a member costs around #600, which is split equally between a joining fee and subscription. Mr Macdonald said it was difficult to assess how many new members were admitted in a year because different categories like six-day membership had improved the situation. ''It was said to be 15 years from the point of application to entry, and I would certainly think that term has been reduced but I would not like to guess by how much.'' He said Deeside was a very attractive course but he did not think that being a member was any sort of status symbol.

A PAEDIATRICIAN yesterday told Falkirk Sheriff Court of a horrific injury suffered by a three-year-old boy. Dr George Farmer told the court he had not seen anything like it in his 15-year career. Dr Farmer, consultant paediatrician at Falkirk Royal Infirmary, was giving evidence in the trial of James Tulloch, 38. Mr Tulloch, of Ettrick Court, Hallglen, Falkirk, denies cutting the boy's penis with a knife, kicking him on his private parts, and squeezing his penis to his injury. The offences are alleged to have taken place at a house in Grangemouth, Stirlingshire, in 1993. Dr Farmer said the toddler's penis had been cut three quarters of the way around its circumference. He said the boy's penis had been squeezed so hard it could be described as ''strangulation''. He said the boy's penis was deliberately cut and squeezed so hard that blood vessels had burst. The doctor added that he examined the youngster in hospital as detectives held an investigation into the wounding. He said the injuries could not have been accidental or self-inflicted. He added that the injury would have been very painful. Tulloch told the court the boy's penis was cut when the youngster tripped and fell on top of him while he was holding a Stanley knife in the bathroom which he was repairing. He said he didn't report the incident to the authorities ''because that was his mum's responsibility''. He said he wasn't concerned because the injuries were ''only slight''. A verdict is expected today.

THE battle standards have been lowered and a ceasefire agreed in the 18-month conflict within the troubled Bute and Cowal Tourist Board. Following the deposing of chairman Douglas Campbell by board directors two weeks ago, both sides in the dispute have entered into negotiations for the first time since the merger of Dunoon and Bute area tourist authorities in May 1993. The newly appointed chairman, Dunoon hotelier Robert Dodds, and hoteliers on the Isle of Bute met yesterday in Rothesay to discuss grievances. Mr Dodds said it was an attempt to find a way forward and a united front to deal with the merger of Bute and Cowal with Stirling, The Trossachs, and Loch Lomond scheduled for next year. He said: ''We have had a most fruitful meeting at which we have agreed that Bute's Islands Hotels Ltd membership be put forward for acceptance by our entire board of directors. Once that has been confirmed we can go forward together and be properly represented on the new area tourist board steering group. ''Now we are talking together and I intend to run this tourist authority in a much more democratic way. The past differences are over, we intend to go forward with a joint marketing initiative. We are all in this together and its our businesses that are at risk.'' Following the merger of the two area tourist authorities in 1993, rows broke out after: * Sixty hoteliers from Dunoon and Rothesay were barred from taking part in the inaugural meeting of their own tourist board. A legal battle ensued and the hoteliers were granted an interdict preventing the directors holding meetings in their absence. * The chairman and vice- chairman spent #10,000 of members' fees on legal costs to fight the hoteliers. * Three elected directors from Bute were removed from their positions on the board. * Hotel and guest house owners in Cowal and on Bute broke away to form their own marketing organisations and produce their own publicity brochures. Despite attempts at reconciliation, the breakaway hoteliers continued to disagree with the way in which the board was being run. Mr Campbell was eventually replaced as chairman by Mr Dodds. Yesterday's meeting was welcomed by Mr Ray Dalton, chairman of the Bute hoteliers' group. He said: ''We are pleased that this approach has been made and it opens the door for more hoteliers to join. ''If we had all got together 12 months ago we might not have had this strife.'' The two groups are now considering a joint issue of their forthcoming 1995 tourist brochures.

A MAN was remanded in custody yesterday at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court, accused of a series of offences at the same court 24 hours earlier. At the time, Mrs Anne Graham, 35, a mother who was recently served an eviction order with her family from their Glenrothes home, was making a private appearance at the court. Mr James McNulty, 26, of Lochiel Gardens, Glenrothes, was accused of threatening violence to the lieges, challenging the lieges to fight, placing them in a state of fear and alarm, and exposing his buttocks. He is further charged with assaulting court officers Samuel Hamilton and Francis Ward, urinating outside the courthouse, and wilfully damaging a car by walking on the boot, convertible soft-top, and bonnet. He was also charged with forcing entry to a house at 97 Queen Margaret Drive, Glenrothes, assaulting one occupant with a pool cue, and resisting arrest. Mrs Graham and her husband Gordon, 39, sat in the public benches when Mr McNulty appeared yesterday. Trial was set for February 13.

A CAMPAIGN launched earlier this year to catch motor tax cheats in Strathclyde, Grampian, and the Highlands and islands has been hailed as a ''great success'' by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. However, while 52.6% of evaders in Grampian relicensed their vehicles during a month-long campaign, the figure was less convincing in Strathclyde and the Highlands and islands, where only 9.3% and 11.6% of culprits respectively came forward. The crackdown involved two weeks of warnings and publicity before two weeks of enforcement by DVLA officials and police manning random road checks during June and September. It resulted in 6436 previously untaxed vehicles being licensed. The measure raised almost #600,000 of revenue for the Department of Transport and resulted in 800 drivers, who ignored DVLA advice to check that their vehicles had valid tax discs, being reported for prosecution. The owners of private cars or motor cycles who have defaulted could face the maximum fine of #1000. Heavy goods vehicle owners face a fine of up to #25,000. The DVLA figures show that 2700 vehicles previously untaxed before the campaign in Strathclyde were now licensed. However, the figure equates to only 9.3% of the 29,000 total of vehicles in the region identified by the DVLA as being without road tax before the campaign. A similar story was recorded in the Highlands and Islands. Although 579 people came forward to tax their vehicles this equated to only 11.6% of the 5000 unlicensed vehicles before the campaign. The best response was achieved in the Grampian area, where 3157 previously untaxed vehicles -- 52.6% of the total of 6000 -- were licensed. Mrs Lynne Hopkins, campaign co-ordinator with the DVLA in Swansea, said yesterday: ''We are extremely pleased with the figures. People obviously heeded the message of the publicity and relicensed their vehicles, bringing in revenue which might not otherwise have been collected.'' The response in the Grampian area was among the best recorded by the DVLA. The reaction in Strathclyde and the Highlands and islands was nearer the national average. Mrs Hopkins said: ''While results in Grampian were obviously better, tax evaders in the two other targeted areas should not become complacent. The net is closing in and we will be back.'' She explained that people who faced court action after the crackdown were those whose vehicles had been unlicensed for one month or more before the campaign began. It did not involve those whose licences were due to expire. The DVLA estimated that there were about 75,000 unlicensed vehicles in Scotland before the campaign, with almost two million vehicles having valid tax discs. No-one from Grampian Police was available for comment yesterday. Spokesmen for Strathclyde Police and Northern Constabulary were reluctant to comment on the figures but pointed out that motor tax evasion, as with drink driving, was monitored throughout the year.

MANY newly-qualified teachers are failing to secure full-time posts, it was revealed yesterday, a trend criticised by Scotland's biggest teaching union. Statistics from the Scottish Office Education Department indicated that, of newly-trained teachers who qualified in 1993, only 55% of primary and 44% of secondary graduates were known to be in full-time teaching posts in Scotland by March last year. Mr Fred Forrester, deputy general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland, said: ''I am concerned about the mismatch between teacher supply and demand. ''Every year, a large percentage of the output does not gain permanent employment and the problems tend to increase because there are teachers from the previous year still looking for a job. ''We believe more teachers should be employed to bring down class sizes.'' The instances of teachers on short-term contracts and supply lists is increasing because of pressure on council finances. Other data shows that teacher numbers have fallen since the late 1970s but the pupil/teacher ratio has also decreased, reflecting a drop in pupil numbers over the same period.

The saga rolls on. The much-publicised private lives of the royal family and friends took a new turn yesterday with the announcement that Camilla Parker Bowles and her husband are to divorce. Anne Simpson casts an individual eye on the proceedings. LET us not mince words. In all this sorry news, the very plainness of Camilla Parker Bowles provides her only asset with the public. Here is no Jezebel, no vain temptress out to trap a future king through glamour-puss wiles. This is a high-caste country woman, whose gumboots style and impressive downright sense of purpose are not unlike those of her lover's mother. In this sense, then, Camilla has never really threatened the mystique of the sainted and beautiful Diana. Yet in a cruel way, her obvious denial of elegance has seemed to make the Prince of Wales's desire for her appear not merely risky but incomprehensible. However, the most pitiable figure throughout has been that of tradition's compliant and long-suffering dupe, the cuckolded husband. Today, however, Brigadier Andrew Parker Bowles, affable sport and definitive English gentleman, marches towards freedom's road with the announcement that he and his wife are to end their marriage of 21 years. Yet all through the prurient and sniggering time which he has endured, the impediment to any offical marital break-up between the two was always taken to be the brigadier's Roman Catholicism. Now, strangely, that problem appears to be on hold as Parker Bowles, newly retired from Army discipline, not only seeks a civilian career, but also finds himself about to join Britain's leading European statistics for divorcees. So, less than half way through the first month of the new year, the Saga of Splitsville ruptures on. The mistress and her husband are breaking up their marital home but she is not yet moving into any pad in a palace. The lover is staying on at his place in the country and when in town mostly resides at his grandmother's. The prospect of his divorce grows hourly more convincing but remains officially denied. That, of course, means nothing any more. All along the line on this story of mismatch and suffering, people in high places have been economical with the truth. But are we fools to be scandalised by any of this? Britain's past monarchy with its mistresses and illegitimate children (William IV, who died in 1837, had 10 children by one actress, a monogamy of sorts), has a history which would cause blushes in a brothel. And these present goings-on are, after all, pretty normal upper-crust activity. Two couples have had their two children -- one heir and one spare -- and their paths diverge, causing each to lead entirely separate lives from their original partners. No aristocrat considers this remotely odd but what is different now is that the pretence at protocol won't wash with the public any more, and well the Windsors know it. Jonathan Dimbleby's recent authorised biography was Prince Charles's courageous acknowledgement of that fact. So were Andrew Morton's spectacular studies on Diana. In the 1930s, when the then Prince of Wales was besotted by the twice-divorced Baltimore socialite, Wallis Simpson, the British press kept quiet, thereby encouraging his ruinous sense of invulnerability. Stung, perhaps, by this reality, the present Prince of Wales, aged 46, has sought to be more candid, confessing his adultery, by way of television, in the very middle of the nation's living room. But those who live by publicity -- as the Windsors have lately chosen to do -- can be roasted by it, particularly when monarchy itself is invested with religious gravity. The sovereign is ''defender of the faith'', whatever that means these days in a country where mosques are likely to be more crowded than any Church of England service. A generation ago, an Archbishop of Canterbury, when asked about the royals' theological tastes, replied sniffily: ''They're all Low Church. It's because they come from abroad.'' Today's Church of England is pragmatic enough to understand it would face an insuperable problem if it voiced resolute hostility to the idea of Charles replacing Diana with Camilla for a wife. ''The Church is terrified of disestablishment,'' says Dr David Starkey, lecturer in history at the London School of Economics. ''If it objected and effectively declared UDI, it would have to go it alone and then would be in a position of having to pay its own clergy out of collections rather than endowments. The Church is in no position to go it alone.'' In Scotland, the monarch is not head of the established Church and so these problems do not arise. But even without them, is marriage to Camilla a realistic option for the Prince? Two years after the official separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales, their divorce is now regarded as inevitable. ''Timing and terms are in their own hands,'' says Nigel Evans, editor of Majesty magazine. Evans believes that, out of concern for their children the couple will wait until their two sons are well established at boarding school before instigating proceedings. ''That would be convenient.'' In one sense, the Parker Bowles divorce may tidy things up. During recent months, there has been speculation among Gloucestershire's landowners -- over whose rich acres the Prince and Camilla like to ride with the Beaufort -- that the pressure of her unresolved situation has been causing ever more distress. According to royal watchers, the word is that Camilla, upset that she is always painted as the mere mistress, is seeking a new image which would give her ''elevated legitimacy alongside the Prince''. Her own marriage, say friends, has been one of independent togetherness, but intermittently over 22 years, the Prince has chosen her as his closest confidante. She is, according to Lord Charteris, permanent Lord-in-Waiting to the Queen, ''the love of his life'', but in fact her divorce now raises more questions than it answers. As long as she and Andrew are still married, all disobliging problems can be kept at bay: but now is the Prince to be seen officially in public with the 47-year-old Camilla? In due course, will the citizenry be ready to accept her as his wife? On that first matter, Charles's aides are already preparing the ground. A senior member of his office observes: ''People have to understand that HRH is legally separated and that Mrs Parker Bowles is, as everyone knows, a friend of the Prince. It would be unimaginable that such good friends should not meet, and if they are seen, then so what?'' The second issue is far more difficult. Camilla has no public following and might well be always unacceptable to the majority as queen. But that would not prevent a morganatic marriage whereby she wins the king, but not the complementary title. They could, of course, just reinforce the common trend and co-habit, with Princess Anne, that most able royal, acting as consort. Certainly Diana will never be queen. Graceful, wilful, hard-working, the noblewoman who brought glamour to the stuffy grandeur of the Windsors has demystified monarchy more rapidly than any republican could ever have dreamed of doing. As a result, subversive talk of republicanism is now discussed with a noisiness which would have been unthinkable a decade or so ago. That seasoned monarchy pundit, Harold Brooks-Baker, insists that, should Charles decide to marry Camilla in the near future, then the chances of Britain turning into a republic would be 50-50. ''However, if the Prince married Camilla Parker Bowles five or 10 years from now, public reaction would be relatively minimal.'' What also needs to be remembered is our national capacity for deceit and the prurience of the great British public, always outraged about invasions of privacy but hiking up the tabloid sales with every livid disclosure. If the monarchy were not there to gawp at, the private lives of politicians would be held in even more ruthless scrutiny. Twenty years ago, on the very eve of Britain's wedding of the decade, Robert Carr trotted into the House of Commons bearing a startling message from the mother of the bride. ''Her Majesty has deemed it proper to declare that a state of emergency exists.'' Waving a piece of paper signed by the Queen, the Home Secretary announced that a work-to-rule by the miners posed serious threat ''to the essentals of life in the community''. It was November 1973, and the beginning of Edward Heath's darkest hour. How things have changed. There have been four Prime Ministers since Heath's hapless premiership, the coal mines are all but redundant, Princess Anne, the bride of that moment, has divorced and remarried, and every other month now the darkest hour -- since the last one -- afflicts the monarchy itself. Every one has his own burdens but, by their continual whingeing for sympathy, by way of media leaks, the royals have revealed how maladroit they have become in handling tales of not uncommon heartache. Of the divorced among them, Lord Snowdown stands as an exemplary figure of discretion and dignity. Princess Margaret's former husband has never whined about his marital lot to the press, never exposed his two well-balanced children to the playing- off of one spiteful set of courtiers against another. Today's news has probably done nothing to improve Prince Charles's popularity. Diana still outshines him in public esteem, his recent intimate disclosures only fixing him in the nation's mind as someone in the throes of babbling psychotherapy. We demand honesty in politicians but we still won't allow it from the Crown. It is as if we are saying that, because the royal family contributes nothing to the workings of the world, it must exist only as a glimpse of wonderland. That is its curious punishment, and the destruction of such a nonsensical image by one of its own is taken to be treason in reverse. Royal relationship spans two decades THE Prince of Wales fondly called her ''Gladys'', the Princess reportedly dubbed her ''The Rottweiler''. Earthy, horse-loving, aristocratic, in the public imagination, Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles has been an intriguing foil for the glamorous Princess. Mrs Parker Bowles first met Charles on Windsor Great Park polo field in 1970 when he had just left Cambridge University. During 1970, the two were seen together frequently. However, in 1971, Charles joined the Navy and the relationship cooled. In 1973, Camilla married Andrew Parker Bowles and their son Tom was born a year later. Charles became his godfather. Charles and Mrs Parker Bowles became close again in the late 1970s but once more the relationship cooled as he looked in earnest for a bride. She was one of those who approved of his choice of Diana Spencer. However, Andrew Morton, in the book Diana, Her True Story, claims Diana sees Mrs Parker Bowles as the woman who poisoned her marriage from the outset. She believed Charles had a tryst with his old flame two days before their wedding and her suspicions were raised by a gold bracelet he presented to Mrs Parker Bowles. With unprecedented candour, Charles has admitted adultery -- but said it only happened after his marriage broke down. He never named Mrs Parker Bowles but made a public pledge of loyalty to their friendship. It is thought their affair resumed in the mid 1980s but the relationship was not public knowledge -- until the bombshell of the so-called Camillagate As the storm surrounding the royal marriage has grown, Mrs Parker Bowles has never spoken publicly about her relationship with Charles, Steadfast loyalty finally exhausted BRIGADIER Andrew Parker Bowles has kept a dignified silence during the years of intense media speculation over his wife's relationship with the Prince of Wales. A guest at Charles's stag night just a week before he married the Princess of Wales in 1981, he has never publicly criticised the Prince. However, asked by reporters how he was feeling, at a recent reception at Horseguards Parade soon after his retirement from the army, the Brigadier replied: ''It can't get any worse.'' Known for his steadfast loyalty to the crown, he has kept quiet about the rumours and revelations surrounding his wife, even during the controversy over the ''Camillagate'' tape in January 1993. Brigadier Parker Bowles has always dismissed claims about the relationship between his wife and the Prince as ''rubbish'', despite the tape -- a highly intimate conversation which was recorded secretly and released to newspapers. Recently, however, more substantiated revelations have surfaced, including the Prince's televised confession that he committed adultery during his marriage and references to an intimate relationship with Mrs Parker Bowles in his authorised biography. It is thought these revelations finally exhausted the brigadier's loyalty, leading to yesterday's announcement. Educated at leading Catholic public school Ampleforth, near York, he joined his father's regiment, the Royal Horse Guards, after attending Sandhurst, serving in Northern Ireland in the early 1970s. He met Camilla Shand in 1966 and they married in July 1973. The statement by the Parker Bowles HERE is the statement from solicitors Charles Russell and Boodle Hatfield: Brigadier and Mrs Parker Bowles have asked that it be known that they have instructed us to seek on their behalf a termination of their marriage. They have two children, a son and a daughter, aged 20 and 16 respectively. They have in addition asked that we publish the following joint statement from them: ''The decision to seek an end to our marriage was taken jointly and is a private matter. But as we have no expectation that our privacy will be respected, we issue this statement in the hope that it will ensure that our family and friends are saved from harassment. ''Most especially, we ask that our children, who remain our principal concern and responsibility, be left alone to pursue their studies at what is clearly a difficult time for them. ''Throughout our marriage, we have always tended to follow rather different interests but, in recent years, we have led completely separate lives. We have grown apart to such an extent that, with the exception of our children and a lasting friendship, there is little of common interest between us, and we have therefore decided to seek divorce.''

A DENTIST who died of Aids continued to practice after lying to health authorities, telling them he had stopped, it was revealed yesterday. Letters went out last night to 1300 former patients, including 67 children, offering free HIV tests, after London dentist Mr Vikram Advani died in November 1993 after contracting the virus. However, the health authority admitted that guidelines might be inadequate and legislation would be needed to force infected workers to stop. The guidelines state that health workers contracting HIV have to consult an Aids specialist and follow their advice. Mr Advani did this and was told to stop practising but continued working with private patients. Concerned health chiefs had searched his records to trace former patients dating back to 1988 and the switchboards have already been busy with calls from worried patients. Professor Newall Johnson of the King's College School of Medicine and Dentistry explained the risk of contracting HIV from your dentist. He said: ''The risk really is extremely small. ''The most telling piece of evidence is that there is only one example in the whole world of the infection being passed from a dental worker to a patient and that was in Florida.'' He said this case in London was being taken so seriously on ''predominantly ethical grounds -- a patient's right to know''. Mr John James, chief executive of the Kensington, Chelsea, and Westminster health commissioning agency, said it had taken a year to compile a list of Mr Advani's patients from 1988. Mr Advani was an NHS dentist at a practice in Camden Road, Camden, until 1991, when he left the Camden and Islington Health Authority by his own choice. Then he set up a private practice at his home in Kensington. In February 1993, he became seriously ill and was advised to stop practising but his record shows he continued to see patients up until at least July in the same year. When asked if greater checks should be placed on HIV dentists to ensure they do not practise when they have been medically advised not to, the health authority said it was a matter for the Government. Mr James added: ''Our guidelines are among the most stringent in the world. ''If the guidelines had been followed, then all this would not be necessary.''

SCOTTISH Television must continue making its Gaelic soap, Machair, in a Gaelic-speaking area as the price for continued financial support, the Mp for the Western Isles insisted yesterday. The company gets #2.3m of the #8.9m the Gaelic Television Committee is receiving from the Scottish Office this year. It makes 26 episodes of Machair, filmed so far in Lewis. A switch to a Glasgow studio is feared, leaving Lewis with the locations shots. Mr Calum MacDonald, the area's Labour MP, said last night: ''I hope the GTC will be firm and insist that the quid pro quo of continued financing of this series will be its continued location in a Gaelic-speaking area. ''The GTC itself has made the point strongly that the public investment in Gaelic broadcasting is not just an investment in the language but also in the economy. ''This positive connection between the language and the economy is absolutely essential to maintain. ''Any move by STV to move production to Glasgow, whether for one week or for the whole series, would break that connection. ''I fear that the medium to long-term impact of that upon public support for Gaelic broadcasting would be profoundly damaging.'' Scottish Television said no decisions had been taken. A GTC meeting next Wednesday will discuss Machair, among other projects. A protest against the possible withdrawal of the filming on Lewis has also been made by the Labour group of the Western Isles Islands Council to Mr John Angus Mackay, director of the GTC. Councillor Roderick Murray, the Labour group's Gaelic spokesman, said: ''If this news is correct, it is most depressing for the islands and for the Gaelic language. ''It is a matter of great concern that so many of the benefits which are arising from Gaelic language development are being siphoned off and transferred to other areas of Scotland. ''The further development of Gaelic can only proceed with the help of island Gaelic speakers and, rather than adding to depopulation by enticing young islanders into Gaelic-related employment elsewhere, more effort should be made to bring this development to the islands.''

MRS Rosemary West's lawyer said yesterday he was to ask for charges against her to be dropped after she was again remanded in custody. Mrs West, 41, who faces nine murder charges, was appearing for the first time since her husband was found hanged in his cell at Winson Green jail, Birmingham, on January 1. Gloucester magistrates agreed to withdraw proceedings against her husband, Mr Frederick West, after a formal application by the Crown Prosecution Service. Defence solicitor Leo Goatley made no application for bail yesterday. Mrs West, who wore a white blouse and navy blue cardigan, was remanded in custody until February 6, when committal proceedings on the nine murder charges she faces will take place at Dursley magistrates' court, Gloucestershire. The committal hearing is expected to last a week. Mr Goatley said after the hearing that he would apply at the committal proceedings for all charges against Mrs West to be dropped on grounds which would include arguments over prejudicial press reporting. ''I will be making an application along these lines in due course,'' Mr Goatley said. ''I already take the view that press coverage has seriously prejudiced the prospect of a fair trial. ''I would ask the media to act with restraint.'' Reporting restrictions were in force at yesterday's hearing and would remain for the committal proceedings, he said. Mrs West, a mother-of-eight, was married to Mr West for 22 years. She is accused of murdering nine young women, including her 16-year-old daughter Heather, over a 20-year period. The charges involve nine women whose remains were uncovered by police in the house and garden at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester, last year. In court for the remand hearing yesterday was Mr West's daughter, Mrs Anne Marie Davis, 30, who identified her father's body. Mrs Davis, 30, is the youngest daughter of Mr West and his first wife, Catherine Costello.Mr West had been in custody charged with 12 murders. After the hearing, Mrs West was taken back to Pucklechurch Remand Centre, near Bristol. Mr Goatley added: ''My client is resilient. She has the support of her family and confidence in her defence team. She is innocent.''

MONEY could be available to increase fishery protection efforts off the British coast, Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave suggested yesterday as he faced accusations from Tory MPs that he had betrayed the fishing industry. Mr Waldegrave told MPs that last month's decision by the European Council of Ministers -- in the face of British opposition -- to give the Spanish fishing fleet access to traditionally British waters was the best deal possible. Defending the outcome of the negotiations, Mr Waldegrave suggested more money might be found for Royal Navy fishery protection patrols to ensure strict compliance. Labour's fisheries spokesman, Mr Gavin Strang, told Mr Waldegrave: ''This deal is a disaster for our fishing communities and represents a wholesale failure by the Government.'' Britain failed to persuade other EU members to join in a complete exclusion of Spanish fishing vessels from the waters known as the Irish Box, which runs from the south-west of England to the north of Scotland.

A DRINK driver was jailed for two and a half years yesterday after he was involved in a crash which killed his fiancee. Learner driver John Hector MacKay, 37, a steelworker, was also banned from driving for five years following the crash which killed passenger Dee Campbell, 33. He was found guilty at Tain Sheriff Court of dangerous and drink driving and also of driving with no insurance and a bald tyre. Defence lawyer Donald MacKenzie said MacKay, of New Street, Inver, by Tain, Easter Ross, was ''devastated'' by the accident, which happened last March. He had been more than two and a half times the legal alcohol limit. Police described how the car flew through the air after hitting a wall and somersaulted on to its roof into a field. Ms Campbell, of Craigton Avenue, Milngavie, Glasgow, died 11 days after the accident at Portmahomack, near Tain. Mr MacKenzie said MacKay, who was slightly hurt in the crash, wanted to visit his fiancee in hospital in Aberdeen but her distressed family told him to stay away. Before the accident, MacKay was seen to fall asleep over a bar meal before driving off from a hotel with his fiancee.

POLICE in Edinburgh are hunting a sex attacker in a wig made from Japanese hair. They describe him as sick, and say he might strike again. He posed as a parcel delivery man and appeared to have planned his assault on a Japanese woman with precision. He pulled a gun and ordered the woman into a bedroom after conning his way into a building on the city's South Side. The victim, who told officers later she would rather die than be dishonoured, struggled so much he eventually fled. He left behind the wig, a dummy parcel with a false logo and genuine franked Far East stamps, handcuffs, and the pistol, which was imitation. Police also found a boilersuit and a baseball cap. Details of other items are not being disclosed by officers, who say a picture has emerged of a sick and dangerous individual. The incident happened on December 20. The man is described as 5ft 6in to 5ft 8in, in his early thirties, and of medium to stout build. He had short brown hair and was unshaven.

TWO Ayrshire families who lost daughters in violent circumstances have been united in grief. The families of murdered women Shona Stevens from Irvine and Sandra Parkinson from Stevenston have been in touch with each other to offer support and find ways of dealing with their loss. Miss Stevens, 31, of Alder Green, Irvine, died on November 13, 1994, three days after being savagely beaten on the way back from the shops. Miss Parkinson was killed last July near the hotel in Salcombe, Devon, where she worked. She had been on a cliff walk when her attacker struck. Miss Stevens's killer is still at large, while the man who murdered Miss Parkinson, Alan Conner, 32, was found hanged in Cambridgeshire. A note begging the forgiveness of her family lay beside his body and DNA tests confirmed he was the killer. The link between the two families was disclosed yesterday when Miss Stevens's mother Mhari Smith made an emotional appeal for more people to come forward and help the murder squad find her daughter's killer. She said: ''I want this killer caught. I would be satisfied then that there is not someone walking around out there who is capable of doing something like this. This could happen to some other family and I would not like that.'' Mrs Smith was speaking as the murder inquiry entered its ninth week, with detectives admitting that they were no nearer to establishing a definite line of inquiry, let alone tracking down the killer. She thanked the hundreds of people who had sent messages of sympathy but singled out the mother and brother of Miss Parkinson, both of whom had sent letters of support and concern. Dismissing suggestions that the inquiry was being scaled down, Detective Chief Inspector Bob Lauder said: ''There are dozens of dedicated and enthusiastic officers who are as determined as I am to detect the person who carried out this very serious crime. ''We have already interviewed 3500 people, and these interviews will continue, but we have not found anyone who saw Miss Stevens being attacked or who holds a direct clue to her attacker.''

PRIME Minister John Major yesterday stepped into the controversy over the export of calves by calling for a reduction in the live animal trade. Mr Major told the Commons that he and Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave would like to see more meat exported on the hook. However, he defended Mr Waldegrave, who has come under fire because calves from his family farm in Somerset have found their way into French veal crates, and denied that Ministers were ''turning a blind eye'' to the veal trade. ''Mr Waldegrave has done more than most people in this country to try to change the laws right across Europe to deal with veal,'' he said. ''Both he and I would like to see less trade in live animals and more in carcass form.'' The focus of the protest against exports is set to move away from the West Sussex port of Shoreham, scene of violent protests during the past week. Around 60 demonstrators gathered on Monday night before discovering that no shipments were leaving the port. It was thought there would be no shipments last night. A leading animal welfare group is taking its campaign against the continental veal trade to France. Labour MP Eric Martlew is to launch a Bill calling for the export of calves to continental veal crates to be banned. And demonstrators are expected to target airports in the West Midlands and South Wales in the near future. Compassion in World Farming, which has led the fight against veal crates, yesterday unveiled new video evidence showing calves tethered by the neck in tiny crates at a farm near Bordeaux, after a 20-hour journey from the West Country. Officials will today show the footage in Paris. Flights are also likely to resume from Coventry this week, less than a month after a plane returning from carrying calves to the continent crashed, killing five people. An Irish export company is seeking approval to fly animals from Swansea. CIWF's political and legal director Peter Stevenson said it was not good enough for farmers to use Mr Waldegrave's argument and say they did not know where calves were bound once they had been to market. ''Farmers have to take responsibility for the destination of their animals,'' he said.

ONE of the all-time great amateur golfers, Jimmy Walker of Irvine, has died aged 73. He was a Walker Cup player, Scottish Amateur Champion, and an internationalist between 1954 and 1963. He died suddenly on Sunday. He won Walker Cup selection for the 1959 match against America at Muirfield but he was injured in a car crash, losing a kneecap, and did not play. In 1961, at Turnberry, he lost in the final of the British Amateur Championship to Michael Bonallack, now secretary of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club. That same year, he won the Scottish Amateur at Western Gailes. He was also a four- time winner for Irvine of the Evening Times Foursomes in 1953, 1960, 1962, and 1963.

FORMER Scottish champion Jimmy McGinty died at the weekend while out cycling with friends. He was 59. National junior title winner in 1953, he was particularly proud of his 5000 metres grass track championship success in 1962, a title subsequently won by each of his sons, Stephen, Allan, and Graeme. He is survived by his wife, Ishbel, his three sons, and daughter June.

THE Glasgow-based charity, Sense Scotland, yesterday chose its 10th birthday to launch a #250,000 appeal, which the charity hopes will fund a significant expansion of its work with deaf-blind children and adults. The charity, which grew from a support group set up by six families, now expects to spend more than #2m this year on providing services such as respite care, residential places, and counselling for more than 220 families affected by deaf-blindness or rubella. Sense Scotland's director, Mrs Gillian Morbey, said yesterday: ''Although we handle about 120 children and between 80 and 100 adults, we are based predominantly in Strathclyde and we know there are at least 400 cases throughout Scotland who could benefit from the services we provide. ''This new appeal will let us provide new centres in Fife, Dundee, and Coatbridge, and a new Pollokshields facility that will complement our three Glasgow centres.'' Sense Scotland hopes to raise the funds from public appeals, its network of charity shops, corporate sponsors, and from a variety of events throughout the year, including the June publication of an anniversary book containing stories from various prominent Scots. The money will go to help children like five-year-old Nicholas McGarry, whose giggling antics in the intimidating Satinwood Suite of the City Chambers in the midst of acting Lord Provost Bailie Dingwall's speech were an occasion for praise not punishment in the eyes of his parents, Stephen and Norma, from Airdrie. ''A couple of years ago, Nicholas would have been hiding in the cloakroom under a pile of coats instead of out in front of the stage,'' said Mr McGarry, director of a catering company. Despite being vaccinated, Mrs McGarry suffered German measles during her pregnancy, with the result that Nicholas is one of the last ''rubella babies'' born in Scotland. The charity's health development officer, Ms Linda Long, said: ''All our clients have a range of impairments but we can make progress with them, and help them to communicate with the outside world, some for the first time.'' Sense Scotland can be contacted at its Glasgow head office, 8 Elliot Place, Clydeway Centre, Glasgow, or by telephone on 041 221 7577.

TEN Labour councillors in Scotland will find out from the postman later this week whether they have won their cases to remain as possible councillors. The 10 are amongst 28 Labour members who attended appeals last night after local vetting committees decided they no longer filled the criteria to be councillors. The case of the three Edinburgh councillors -- Mr David Brown, Mr Spike Wilson, and Mr Billy Fitzpatrick -- was the most controversial. All three had defied a party whip during a vote of confidence over Edinburgh District Council's then chief executive Paul Lowenberg. It was widely felt that all three were being punished for defying the party line. The reasons for their exclusion from a list of possible future candidates were never explained to them, however. Last night, they had the opportunity to explain their case when members of Labour's Scottish executive held two appeals meetings, one in Glasgow, the other in Edinburgh. Fourteen members in Glasgow, including three current councillors, five in Renfrew, including three councillors also, eight in Edinburgh, and a councillor in Fife, had appealed against their removal from possible candidates' lists. Some of the reasons for removal were straightforward, where members did not have the proper residential qualifications, or even could not prove they were paid up members of the party. Other cases, though, concern the more complicated question of capability. A Labour Party spokesman said that the decision of the sub-committees would be posted out to them today by first class post, and that they should know tomorrow.

THE managing director of a Glasgow company will appear on national television tonight enthusiastically demonstrating the effectiveness of an electric shock baton -- outlawed by this country in 1988 -- as he was secretly filmed attempting to secure what he thought could be a #2m export order for his firm. Batons of this style -- originally designed for use in crowd control -- have been rejected in the West and are claimed by Amnesty International to have been adopted as effective instruments of torture by unscrupulous governments. The Glasgow plastics firm had exported models to China a year after the Tiananmen Square massacre with the blessing of the British Government, Mr Frank Stott, managing director of ICL Technical Plastics of Glasgow boasts in front of a hidden camera. However a company director insisted to The Herald last night that any interview with Mr Stott was simply part of a ''feasibility study'' and that ICL, based in Hopehill Road, near St George's Cross, had never manufactured for sale any electro-shock equipment. The company's main business is protective equipment such as riot shields for police forces. The Channel 4 Dispatches programme claims that the ICL model was almost certainly used as the blueprint for the Chinese to mass produce their own home-made version. Others had gone to governments in the Middle East and elsewhere. During the secretly-filmed meeting, Mr Stott emphasised how Strathclyde Police wanted the firm's operation kept quiet. Under police instruction, the company had to maintain a low profile, he told an undercover journalist and an actor posing as an arms buyer from the Middle East. The nature of the business was something the police did not want to become general knowledge in Glasgow. Mr Stott, a member of the SAS in his younger days, and vice-president of the West of Scotland Rugby Football Club, thought he was speaking to a buyer from the Middle East and his UK agent and makes no attempt to elicit too many details about their credentials. He makes it clear during the programme that he does not ask questions as to the final destination of his electro-shock batons or the electro-shock shields he sells, nor does he inquire into the final use. ''To be perfectly honest, I don't want the people in Glasgow knowing that we do this. It is one of the conditions that the police granted us permission to manufacture,'' he declares during a sales pitch set up and secretly filmed by Channel 4's Dispatches programme. Mr Stott insists in front of the cameras that his company had the permission of the Scottish Office to manufacture electro-weapons at his factory, as long as they were for export. Even before the Dispatches programme has been broadcast, it has already led to the suspension from duty of an employee at the Royal Ordnance division of British Aerospace. This follows revelations in the programme that one of its salesmen attempted to get involved in a deal to sell electro-shock batons and shields to the television people. The salesman, Mr Philip Morris, also claims during another secretly filmed meeting by independent television company TVF that such pieces of equipment had been sold by BAe as part of the #20,000m al-Yamamah agreement in 1985, to provide jet fighters, naval minehunters, and ammunitions to the Saudis. With the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher playing a key role, this was the biggest arms export contract yet won by this country. BAe was adamant last night that that major deal did not involve the sale of electro-shock equipment. On ICL, the programme will show Mr Stott arriving at a London hotel with a bag containing two electro-shock battons. He had flown from Scotland that day and told the journalist posing as an exporter, that he had been a little bit naughty by carrying them on the aircraft. The Scottish businessman, currently on holiday in The Gambia with his wife, told the television people he had sold similar kit to the then apartheid regime in South Africa. Other sales had been made in the Middle East. During the bogus sales meeting, Mr Stott insisted that the Government was very keen that his company got involved in the export of this ''stuff''. He was shortly to go to South America to sell the equipment in Venezuela, Peru, and Columbia. According to the programme, Mr Stott insisted that the Scottish Office would pay up to one third of the cost of the trip, with funds from the Department of Trade and Industry. All the Scottish Office would say last night was that it was the DTI which paid for trade missions, not it. The Herald has a copy of Mr Stott's letter offering to sell the bogus company electro-shock batons and electro-shock shields, in addition to a copy of the Glasgow company's specification documents, which describe in detail the electro-shock baton. Last night, an ICL spokesman said that it had only gone as far as test marketing and stated it had never sold the product. He claimed that the company wholly concurred with the Amnesty International view that the abuses of such equipment were ''abhorrent''. He pointed out that while there were moral and ethical arguments, passive defence was preferable to public authorities than the use of guns and bullets. Company director Stewart McColl has written to Dispatches saying that an independent audit would show that it had not manufactured for sale, or sold electro-shock equipment to any party, and that the interview recorded with Mr Stott was ''part of a feasibility study''.

A 19-YEAR-old mother of two was jailed for the second time by the same sheriff yesterday before being released on interim liberation pending an appeal. Sheriff David Smith sentenced Mrs Victoria Leiper to 60 days imprisonment for lying to police when she reported an assault by her husband, but she was later released from custody after her lawyer lodged an appeal. Mrs Leiper had originally accused her husband of pointing a gun at her head in an attack at her home but later changed her evidence. It was her first offence. On December 7, Sheriff Smith had remanded Mrs Leiper in custody after deferring sentence till December 28. His decision was overturned six days later by three appeal court judges, who described his decision as ''oppressive''. Sheriff Smith faced criticism from Leiper's family, women's groups, and politicians as his original sentence would have left Mrs Leiper's two children Kyle, now 19 months and Siobhan, eight months, without their mother over Christmas. Mrs Leiper had been cited to appear at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court as the main Crown witness at the trial of her estranged husband Charles. She failed to turn up. A warrant was granted for her arrest but she turned up voluntarily at court the following day, where her husband was admonished by Sheriff Smith after his guilty plea was accepted. Sentencing Mrs Leiper yesterday, Sheriff Smith said that, because of her actions, her husband had spent ''more than three weeks in jail''. He said: ''In my opinion, giving the false account of a crime is in itself a serious matter. The gravity of this far outweighs any personal circumstances of the accused and detention is the only suitable punishment.'' At her home in Kilmarnock, Mrs Leiper said she was scared she might lose her appeal and that she blamed her husband. She had no idea how long her interim liberation would last. Clutching her daughter, Mrs Leiper became pale as she considered the prospect of spending 60 days in Cornton Vale. Described by her mother as a shy, quiet girl, Mrs Leiper found few words for Sheriff Smith yesterday. ''I don't like him,'' she said. Three other decisions to remand young women in custody have been overturned by on appeal at the High Court in the past two years.

ROYAL observers warned yesterday that the actions of the Prince of Wales over the next few months could decide the future of the monarchy, following the announcement that Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles and her husband are to divorce. Constitutional experts said there is no bar to Prince Charles marrying Mrs Parker Bowles, if he divorces the Princess of Wales, but some royal analysts believe such a union could signal the end of the monarchy. In a statement issued through their solicitors yesterday morning, Mrs Parker Bowles and her husband, Brigadier Andrew Parker Bowles, who have been living apart for two years, said they were divorcing by mutual consent after 21 years of marriage. The statement said they had grown apart to such an extent that ''with the exception of our children and a lasting friendship, there is little of common interest between us, and we have therefore decided to seek divorce''. The announcement caused a fresh flurry of speculation over Mrs Parker Bowles's close relationship with the Prince of Wales, and the implications for the future of the monarchy, if the two were to eventually marry. Aides for Prince Charles were quick to point out that the Prince and Princess of Wales had no plans to divorce at present, although other Royal watchers believe it is inevitable. Experts on the monarchy said a marriage between the Prince and Mrs Parker Bowles would have no constitutional effect and no bearing on Charles's right of accession to the Throne. However, royal analysts said the public would not sanction his marriage to Mrs Parker Bowles and the monarchy could be plunged into crisis. Mr Harold Brooks-Baker, publisher of Burke's Peerage, predicted that the Prince's actions over the next few months would decide whether Britain became a republic. ''The confidence of the public in the Prince will be influenced by this divorce because, for as long as Camilla was married, they did not have to contemplate her ever becoming queen. Everything he now does is very important and the future of the monarchy now seems to rest on what Prince Charles decides to do.'' Mr Brooks-Baker said it was ''almost certain'' that the Prince and Princess of Wales would divorce soon but he doubted if Charles would rush into another marriage. ''But it is perfectly obvious that, if he decides to marry Camilla Parker Bowles in the near future, the chance of a republic is far greater, because public sentiment is not in favour of it for a variety of reasons.'' Dr David Starkey, lecturer in history at the London School of Economics, said there were no constitutional bars to such a remarriage and even the Church of England's distaste for divorce and remarriage should not pose any problem. The church's ''insuperable problem'' in terms of its hostility to divorce was countered by the fact that it was terrified of disestablishment, he said. The Prime Minister and the Archbishop of Canterbury had gone out of their way to make it clear that a royal divorce has no impact at all on Charles's accession, he said. ''They have even implied -- with the Bishop of St Albans stating it explicitly -- that even a royal remarriage would not be indigestible. Divorce is not a problem.'' It may be, that should he divorce and remarry, Charles would chose to wed in Scotland like Princess Anne. Where the Church of England is generally opposed to divorcees remarrying before the altar, ministers in Scotland can marry divorcees subject to the welfare of children involved and other considerations. One of the caveats spelled out by the Church of Scotland for remarriage of divorcees is that the minister ''should consider whether there is a danger of scandal arising if he should solemnise the remarriage''. Speaking last night, the principal clerk to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, the Very Rev Dr James Weatherhead, said remarriage for a divorcee was by no means automatic in the Kirk. He said it was up to the individual minister to make the decision. Royal watcher and freelance writer Margaret Holder said there were ''huge similarities'' between the current royal confusion and 1936 abdication crisis. There would be intense speculation as to Charles's future plans, she said, adding: ''Everyone will be wondering whether he will inflict Camilla on the country as queen, which is as unwelcome a prospect as Queen Wallis was in 1936.'' The relationship between Prince Charles and Mrs Parker Bowles has spanned more than two decades. They met at a party in 1972, where the then Camilla Shand reportedly told the Prince: ''My great-grandmother was your great-great grandfather's mistress . . . so how about it?'' She dated the Prince but then married Brigadier Andrew Parke Bowles in 1973. The pair remained close friends and allegedly had three affairs. * Prince Charles is expected to spend the weekend at Balmoral. He is due to arrive on Friday for a private visit after official engagements in Perth.

THE douce denizens of Burnside were never the sort of folks who would be seen dead by the neighbours in their pyjamas. But the Second World War posed a problem: how to maintain that respectable aura when scurrying to the air raid shelter during the blitz? Running the gauntlet of the Luftwaffe while trying to hold on to your dignity and your dressing gown was not easy. One local builder had the solution, he built his own air raid shelter under the living room. At a stroke he improved his family's safety, avoided the rush to the public shelter, and added a useful extra room to the house (although natural light was not one of its features). Fortunately, demand for air raid shelters in Scotland has bombed during recent years, giving them something of a scarcity value. Those that still exist are often converted into wine cellars, darkrooms, or workshops. Glasgow property manager Stephen O'Neill, who has been carpet-bombing the city's market with rental accommodation, is marketing the Burnside property which comes complete with its own air raid shelter. And he offers potential tenants an ideal use for this unusual underfloor feature. ''If your teenage kids are heavily into Take That, Kylie Minogue or heavy metal, the shelter offers an ideal barrier from the booms and bangs of their stereos. You can stick the hi-fi and the kids down there, close the hatch, and enjoy some peaceful bliss.'' The spacious house is situated within large gardens. The air raid shelter, accessed via a hatch in the front living room, is lined with concrete and has its own staircase. The house is of unusual design and the accommodation includes three public rooms, three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen and sun lounge. There is gas central heating and the house comes fully furnished. Burnside is a pleasant residential area with plenty of amenities nearby and good access to Glasgow, East Kilbride, and the motorway network. Anyone who is attracted by the siren call of a bombproof basement can get the all-clear for a competitive rental of #600 a calendar month.

THE old saying ''safe as houses'' has had a hollow ring to it in recent years, but now householders, supported by forward-thinking builders and police, are fighting back by making their homes and their neighbourhoods safer. There also is an increasing trend for people to move away from areas they perceive to be crime-ridden into places where they believe the risk of burglary and violence is much lower. With its low crime rate, Argyll is attracting many Glaswegians, especially retired people, who want to avoid the hassle, cost, and worry of break-ins. Sandhaven, a redevelopment of former US Navy homes in Dunoon, has been attracting people from the Central Belt who say that Argyll's low crime rate is a major reason for moving. Since the estate was launched two years ago, more than 100 homes have been sold to families and retired people. Most buyers were living in central Scotland and England. Selling agent Lorna Stewart says: ''I moved my own family to Dunoon because I wanted to bring my children up in a place that was safe and which could give them the kind of freedom which is hard to find in many parts of the Central Belt. Many of our buyers are over 50, and they say that they want away from higher crime areas, or from local pubs or parks which have become havens for drug addicts etc.'' The good news is that Strathclyde Police statistics show that break-ins were significantly reduced in every part of the region between 1991 and 1993. Break-ins went down by 10.4% while crimes per person dropped by 3.4%. In 1993, Glasgow city centre had Strathclyde's highest crime level with a rate of 0.174 crimes per person; Argyll had the lowest at 0.028 crimes per person that year. Perhaps surprisingly, the police division of Bearsden, Milngavie and Maryhill (0.044 crimes per person) was higher than Cumbernauld, Coatbridge and Airdrie division (0.037), and Kilmarnock, Ayr and Troon division (0.033). Although good locks, peepholes and secure windows have a very important part to play in home security, police forces are now encouraging builders and local authorities to create low-crime neighbourhoods through the design of housing developments. Strathclyde Police has presented Secured by Design awards to CALA Homes and Woolwich Homes for the design of developments at Ralston and Kilmacolm respectively. ''We can reduce crime by looking at the design of the estate as a whole,'' says Inspector John O'Neil, architectural liaison officer for Strathclyde Police. ''We look at the design of footpaths -- you don't want to create easy access behind the houses for anyone who wants to wander through. We also check the quality of lighting, and whether or not the estate has a strong territorial feel to it. ''Residents should be able to recognise a stranger right away. Anyone entering the area should have a reason to be there. If they don't, they should get the strong feeling that they don't belong. It's a mix of physical features and psychology. ''Even where there is a low crime rate, good lighting is important to give women a feeling of safety: we look at street lighting as well as exterior lighting on the houses themselves.'' His unit also looks at playpark design (the houses immediately beside playparks are often the hardest to sell), encouraging builders not to light such areas. ''Playparks should be used only by children under seven -- and they should not be out in the dark. If you provide lighting, it often only attracts teenage drinking groups at night.'' Inspector O'Neil is confident that other builders will want to become part of the scheme when they realise that estates which have been designed to minimise crime will sell faster. Alan Downie, managing director of CALA Homes, says: ''We sold #7m worth of houses at Ralston in a single weekend. Part of that success is due to our commitment to working in partnership with the police to create safe neighbourhoods for our buyers.'' It is not only private house builders who are taking these steps: Monklands District Council and Inverclyde District Council have both won awards for the way in which they have tackled crime when redeveloping council housing. In Coatbridge, Monklands District Council introduced a concierge and security-entry system into high flats while, in a high crime part of Port Glasgow, Inverclyde District Council refurbished a terrace and included factors which should reduce crime from the outset. Many of these ideas have come into UK housing design from the USA, where architects like Oscar Newman have been pushing ideas of ''territoriality'' or ''defensible space'' in neighbourhoods. The idea is to minimise the kind of open space which architects designed into so many Scottish post-war housing estates. Such common space often becomes nobody's space, a kind of ''no go'' area frequented only by drinking gangs, drug abusers, vandals or criminals. Improvements which are reducing the storey height of council housing, giving people their own front door, and dividing common garden space into parcels allocated to particular flats, are transforming previously blighted housing schemes. Last month, Scottish Homes presented awards to community groups in Glasgow and Fife for the safety and security of their neighbourhoods. The Safe Levern/Pollock project was set up three years ago to reduce crime and, almost as important, the fear of crime. Controlled entry systems, better lighting, front door peepholes, and burglar alarms have been installed in several parts of the Levern and Pollock housing areas.

THE governor of Parkhurst has been sacked, and told by Home Secretary Michael Howard he would probably not run a prison again. Mr Howard faced a hostile Commons during a statement on the recent series of apparent blunders in the prison service, including the escape of the three from Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight and the death in custody at Winson Green prison, Birmingham, of Mr Frederick West. He was greeted by cries of ''scapegoat'' and ''resign'' when he told MPs that the Parkhurst governor, Mr John Marriott, was ''today being removed from his duties''. Amid angry scenes, and with the Speaker calling MPs to order, he said: ''Pending the outcome of a disciplinary investigation and any subsequent proceedings, he (Mr Marriott) will not be running any other prison in the prison service. ''When he has completed any assistance which he needs to give to the various inquiries now in hand, he will be taking up non-operational duties elsewhere. Six officers will also be temporarily transferred to duties at other prisons. Both these actions are without prejudice to the outcome of the disciplinary investigation.'' One of the six is Mr Colin Jones, 28, the off-duty officer who spotted the three, leading to their capture on Sunday night, the Prison Officers' Association said. Mr Howard again refused to offer his own resignation and won firm public backing from the Prime Minister. Mr Brendan O'Friel, chairman of the Prison Governors' Association, said later he was in ''no doubt'' that Mr Marriott was being used as a scapegoat. The association's general secretary, Mr David Roddan, said: ''This is a premature and vindictive action designed to pillory the governor of Parkhurst who has consistently called for improved security measures at his prison.'' Mr Howard faced a barrage of questions from MPs on both sides of the House at the end of his statement, in which he ran through the details of the Parkhurst escape, Mr West's apparent suicide in his cell, and the rioting at Everthorpe prison in Humberside. Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw said Mr Howard had ''continued to refuse to accept responsibility for this saga of ineptitude'', and told the House: ''This Home Secretary is the 'not me guv' Home Secretary.'' In his statement to the House, Mr Howard said Sir John Learmont, already reviewing physical security and security procedures throughout the prison service in England and Wales, would be visiting Parkhurst this week along with Sir John Woodcock, who last month compiled a damning report on the IRA breakout from Whitemoor prison. Mr Howard said they would have available to them a report from Mr Richard Tilt, director of security for the prison service, which they would be able to take into account. The Home Secretary said: ''In view of the detailed information about security at Parkhurst in Mr Tilt's report, it would not be appropriate for me to publish it, but the examination of it by Sir John Learmont will ensure that it is independently reviewed. ''They will not be bound by it and the scope of their inquiry will not be limited in any way.'' Mr Howard confirmed that a copied key was used in the break-out and appeared to suggest that, contrary to Prison Service rules, there was no governor on duty at the time of the escape. He said that at Parkhurst there had been ''serious failures at local level by both management and some individual officers to carry out basic security procedures in accordance with the prison service's own written instructions''. Mr Howard said ''certain specific lapses'' on the night of the escape ''contributed significantly to the failure to detect the escape and to the length of time which elapsed before its discovery''. On his own position, Mr Howard said: ''I am determined to take the action that is needed to put things right and I am accountable to this House for that action.'' He insisted there would be ''no question of any cover-up whatsoever''. Mr Howard said Mr West had been seen daily by a doctor, including on the day of his death, when ''his behaviour did not give any cause for concern''. Of the riots at Everthorpe, he said the internal inquiry report had not yet been completed: ''But it has, however, emerged that while there was no single cause of the disturbances, the governor's determined efforts to curb the misuse of drugs in the establishment were an important factor.'' Mr Straw said Mr Howard's statement wholly failed to meet public anxieties about the prison service and he added: ''You stand accused of gross incompetence in the execution of your responsibilities.'' He condemned what he described as Mr Howard's refusal to set up a fully independent inquiry into the Parkhurst breakout. He accused the Home Secretary of trying to evade responsibility by attempting to draw a distinction between policy and operation, which was a fiction. ''The public was put at enormous risk,'' he said. If Mr Howard had taken proper account of earlier warnings, the escape could not have taken place, Mr Straw claimed. Earlier, at Prime Minister's Question Time, Mr Major defended the Home Secretary. He underlined that Ministers had not resigned in similar cases in recent years under different administrations. He stressed that the Home Secretary was responsible for policy but operational matters fell into a different category, as had been the case for very many years. * The hunt for three men -- one a rapist -- who escaped from Littlehey prison in Cambridgeshire earlier this week, yesterday switched to the Irish Republic. Police believe Michael Thynne, 43, Darren Ogden, 23, and Gary Thompson, 25, arrived at Dublin's ferryport on a sailing from Hollyhead, Anglesey.

A MODEST recovery in the housing market could make homeowners in Scotland #3.6 billion richer within 12 months, but it will all depend on the Government. The latest market report from mortgage company HMC says that Scottish house values could rise by an average of #3000 if the Government avoids confidence-destroying measures such as sharp rises in interest rates. The lender has taken a range of City expectations about interest rates during 1995, plus unemployment forecasts for the year, and has fed them into its own house price forecasting model. The gloomier forecasters predict that the Government will raise interest rates steadily throughout 1995 and that there will be no real fall in unemployment, a combination which will see the continuation of the ''feel bad'' factor. HMC says that if the pessimists are right, the average house in Scotland at the beginning of the 1996 will be worth #51,300. But there is a rosier scenario, which HMC has also fed into its computers. If interest rates stay low, if unemployment falls and if consumer confidence rises and the ''feel good' factor returns, HMC says the recovery will begin to work its way through to the housing market during this year. By early 1996, the average Scottish home could be worth around #54,300. That's #3000 more than on the pessimistic forecast, giving Scotland's 1.2 million owner-occupiers an additional #3.6 billion in total. Homeowners in the South East could see the highest increases in value, with an average rise of just under #5000. In the South West and East Anglia, the figure will be between #4300 and #4600.

In a Scotland's Homes article before Christmas, estate agent agent Ian Robb asked: Why should lawyers sell houses? Frank McCormick, chairman of the Glasgow Solicitors Property Centre, replies. IN these uncertain times, what can home buyers and sellers hope for? Low interest rates? Rising demand? Falling unemployment and economic growth? One thing's sure, neither buyers nor sellers are interested in the snipings of estate agents as they come to terms with the significant advances of GSPC. Loth to kick a man when he's down, a blow-by-blow response would be little more than a points-scoring exercise. What follows was penned in a more constructive frame of mind. Back to my original question, surely an improving economic climate ought to be viewed positively by buyers and sellers alike? Yet, consumer confidence seems to be the factor which has lagged longest as the country emerges from recession. Whatever economic cycles we've experienced, it seems this time around, concerns about job security and the potential horrors of negative equity are hindering a full recovery. So just what does encourage someone with a home to sell to consult a solicitor or estate agent? In late 1993, 125 firms of solicitors came together to form the Glasgow Solicitors Property Centre -- GSPC. Since then, sales transactions for over 2750 homes have been successfully concluded. That's 2750 sets of sales commission, handling charge, mortgage arrangement fee and life assurance commission denied to estate agents, which goes some way to explaining their current chagrin. GSPC and its individual competing member solicitors offer a comprehensive, trusted and effective range of property marketing services. We believe we also offer unprecedented value-for-money. We're utterly convinced that ground lost to incoming estate agents over the past 20-odd years will be recaptured. A discerning and quality-conscious property-owning public is starting to recognise the many benefits of consulting their GSPC member solicitor in preference to others. Already, we have gained a 21 per cent share of the market. Don't forget that solicitors have acted for buyers and sellers for hundreds of years in Scotland. In Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Perth, for example, local solicitors' property centres each have 80-plus per cent of the market. The proliferation of non-legally qualified property sales agents is a really quite recent, English phenomenon. That's certainly not intended to decry those who have learned their trade with an estate agent -- far from it. Indeed, some of our members have employed such talent to good effect within their own property sales departments. The point is that estate agents have no exclusive rights when it comes to claiming sales expertise; solicitors offer much more than that, in any event. Let me spell out the GSPC philosophy; we have two overriding, equally important aims. First, we are dedicated to offering a reliable, efficient and cost-effective marketing mechanism for property sellers. Second, we are dedicated to providing as simple, convenient and hassle-free a means to match buyers with a new home as possible, with as comprehensive a choice as possible. Such aims are inextricably linked. As independent lawyers, our expertise extends well beyond legal complexities. Each member solicitor has knowledge of the local property market, as well as having access to the Homeline computer price database, the most up-to-date of its kind. Each member solicitor is familiar with those factors which are likely either to improve or impair a property's saleability. A solicitor, for instance, will know if alterations to a property require planning consent and/or a building warrant. If these are not immediately available, he or she will advise on how retrospective consent or a letter of comfort may be obtained, so removing a potential barrier to a successful sale. Similarly, by studying title deeds, such alterations will be checked for possible breach of feuing conditions. No-one else can offer such an all-embracing service, certainly not an estate agent. Depending on the seller's circumstances, as well as on the size, style, type and location of the property, recommended marketing strategies will naturally vary. For many properties, even in a buyer's market, such a strategy can be kept quite simple -- advertising in the Weekly List and in our city centre showroom. If the need to sell is more acute, or if the selling solicitor believes a particular property is likely to be more difficult to market, then additional newspaper advertising may be recommended. The fact of GSPC's success, disputed only by those fearing for their own business survival, is attracting more firms of solicitors to its ranks. Numbers have swelled to over 140. The message is getting through to consumers, too.0Consumer confidence, particularly with respect to property sales, is a hard nut to crack. Yet with just 15 months' trading behind us, the GSPC has at least shown that it can be done. With a net flow of properties coming off the books of estate agents and on to ours, we think the writing is on the wall. By any measure, we're succeeding.

THE former wife of a disgraced Scottish solicitor has claimed that she faces eviction from her Edinburgh home and is being ''victimised'' by the Scottish legal fraternity. Mrs Helen Mcabe, who practised under the name Helen Wilson, is the former wife of lawyer John McCabe who was jailed for 10 years in 1991 for a #4m fraud. She made her allegations in a long and detailed letter to The Herald. Yesterday, however, after arranging to speak to the newspaper in more detail, she called off the interview via a telephone call from a friend. When McCabe was sentenced at the High Court in Edinburgh, Lord Ross, Lord Justice Clerk, told him that he had disgraced his profession and had been guilty of dishonesty on a vast scale, defrauding banks and building societies who had trusted him because he was a solicitor. The fraud, the largest committed by a solicitor in Scotland, led to the legal profession being forced to meet the losses incurred through its guarantee fund. Mrs McCabe, who said that she had divorced last year, claimed in her letter to The Herald that, because her husband had obtained fraudulent loans against the family home in Northumberland Street, Edinburgh, the Skipton Building Society had taken the view that all sums were considered due and that it wished to repossess the property. Before calling off the promised interview, Mrs McCabe, a solicitor, who had her own practising certificate withdrawn by a Law Society Tribunal in 1991 in connection with the preparation of securities on loans -- not recorded by her former husband -- said: ''I anticipate that the eviction process will take place any time after January 20. I will have to stay with friends,'' she said. She insisted that the solicitors' disciplinary tribunal had found she had been naive and foolish ''but not culpable'' but yesterday the Law Society said that she had been found guilty of professional misconduct. In her letter to The Herald, Mrs McCabe states: ''I am, I hope, a sane, intelligent professional woman, a qualified solicitor, who has been caught up in an appalling situation.'' In documents seen by the newspaper, it emerges, in an ironic twist, that she has now submitted a claim against the Law Society for compensation. ''If John McCabe was acting as my agent and solicitor, it would appear that the Law Society must recompense me,'' she stated. She claimed that the ''real'' loan on the family home was for #50,000, which she knew about, although her former husband had obtained others for #250,000, and that the building society had never communicated with her. Mr Kenneth Pritchard, the secretary of the Law Society, confirmed yesterday that, in the course of an examination into the affairs of Mr McCabe's firm of Scott Moncrieff &amp; Dove Lockhart -- in which he was a senior partner -- and an investigation into various acts of dishonesty, it became apparent that in two cases building societies had instructed Mrs McCabe -- practising under her own name of Helen Wilson -- to act on their behalf in relation to loans. He added: ''Instead of acting on behalf of her clients, (the lending institutions) in the way that was expected of a solicitor, Mrs McCabe prepared the standard securities and gave them to her husband who either destroyed them, and certainly did not record them. ''Her conduct led to two massive claims being made against her firm of J C &amp; A Steuart, a firm which is no longer in business. ''As a result of these two serious claims which were met by the Law Society's indemnity insurers, which in the society's view demonstrated gross professional misconduct on Mrs McCabe's part, a formal disciplinary complaint was taken against her. ''In their interlocutor and findings of September 4, 1991, Mrs McCabe was found guilty of professional misconduct. ''It stated that it was her responsibility to protect their respective interests, and in these circumstances, it was her duty to ensure that the borrower had a good and marketable title to the properties concerned, and that valid securities were recorded in each case as soon as possible after settlement.'' Mr Pritchard added: ''It is accepted that the circumstances were unusual but, nevertheless, she demonstrated an element of naivety and a failure to appreciate her whole responsibilities as a solicitor in relation to her clients. ''For Mrs McCabe to suggest that she was not culpable but naive, is failing to appreciate that she was found guilty of professional misconduct in respect of her failures which led to losses by institutions in excess of #600,000 and is quite extraordinary and wrong.'' Confirming that she had lodged a claim against the solicitors' guarantee fund, Mr Pritchard said that Mrs McCabe was invited to a meeting on December 21, but this was cancelled at her solicitor's request. ''An alternative date has been offered, when the whole question of her claim will be discussed,'' he said. So far as the property at Northumberland Street is concerned Mr Pritchard said: ''The Skipton Building Society raised an action against her to call up the loans. ''The building society has obtained a judgment against her, and they will be seeking possession and sale of the property.'' Alleging victimisation as a result of the costs incurred to the legal profession due to her ex-husband's dishonesty, Mrs McCabe stated: ''Understandably there has been a great deal of bad feeling about his actings in the legal profession and sadly this has been directed against me as well.'' She admitted that she was involved ''albeit innocently'' in some of her husband's business ventures but she asserted that she had no inkling of the true nature of his activities. ''As a result, anyone and everyone who thinks they might have any sort of claim has raised an action against me,'' she claimed. She added: ''I have no money whatsoever and I am presently unemployed. I have not been claiming unemployment benefit, but have been leasing the basement of my house and living on the rent.'' Inquiries were made earlier this week with the Skipton Building Society on the current position of the eviction process. A spokesman said: ''We are making no official comment on this matter.'' Last night, Mrs McCabe was not available to make further comment on her claims and allegations.

THE chief executive of Glasgow Development Agency has attacked the idea that Scots in general, and Glaswegians in particular, lack enterprise and fail to create enough new businesses. In a wide-ranging review of Glasgow's progress towards the first rank of European cities, Mr Stuart Gulliver predicted that the second stage of Glasgow's transformation would need more than a series of ''head-turning events'' like the 1988 Garden Festival or the 1990 Year of Culture. ''The second phase will need to be about more than urban jewellery,'' he said yesterday, at the launch of a new guide to the top 200 businesses in the metropolitan Glasgow area. ''It will have to cut deeper and reach right across the city as a whole. It will require more dynamism all round, more quality, more people orientation and more attention to detail.'' He went on: ''I'm afraid I personally have no time for the view of Scottish people as some kind of pathological case of unentrepreneurial behaviour -- as some kind of business basket case. ''My favourite view is more pragmatic and much more prosaic. It's simply that Scotland is a small, regional market place. ''For me, the biggest single limitation on new business generation in Scotland is the size of the local market. That's a first order condition. Everything else is second order.'' The central issue, he told his audience, was how to generate a volume of good business opportunities disproportionately higher than the local market would generate left to its own devices. In that, he argued, Glasgow has two key advantages -- its scale and the diversity of its existing economic base. With 1.3m people in the metropolitan Glasgow area, a local economy accounting for around one third of Scottish GDP, and rich diversity in the make-up of that base, things could happen which wouldn't happen in smaller centres. Mr Gulliver was speaking to an audience of businessmen and women who attended the launch of Metropolitan Glasgow, a directory of the top 200 companies in the greater Glasgow area. The other main speaker was international management consultant Professor Gordon Hewitt, and the event was chaired by Councillor Pat Lally, leader of Glasgow District Council. The directory was jointly sponsored by the GDA and the council, and compiled by the Scottish Business Insider magazine. It will be distributed to more than 20,000 businesses and commercial organisations in Scotland and abroad. Professor Hewitt was asked what advice he would give to the Glasgow business community to continue the successful transformation of the city. ''The single biggest piece of advice is don't slip into comfort zones: you have to keep stretching and pushing the ambitions,'' he said. For me, the biggest single limitation on new business generation in Scotland is the size of the local market. That's a first order condition. Everything else is second order Stuart Gulliver

A DEFIANT Tony Blair declared last night, amid growing dissention about changing Labour's constitution on nationalisation: ''I am doing this not because it is easy but because it is the right thing to do.'' At stake is the 70-year-old commitment to public control of industry and the markets. The Labour leader used a keynote speech to captains of European industry in Brussels to demand party support for his reform of the notorious Clause Four, which defined socialism for the fledgling Labour Party in 1918. Mr Blair wants to persuade the nation that Labour no longer believes in nationalisation as an economic solution. He turned on his critics in the Labour Party, who are seeking to thwart him at a special conference on ditching Clause 4, on April 30. At the Commons last night, 50,000 letters were despatched to constituency parties and others urging resistance. ''The Labour Party is not a preservation society,'' he said. ''Those who seriously believe that we cannot improve on the words written for the world of 1918 when we are now in 1995 are not learning from history but merely living in it.'' Mr Blair, anxious to reassure British industry, stated there would be ''no ambiguity about our convictions and our determination to carry through our radical programme in government''. He promised: ''The new constitution will state what we actually believe. ''We believe that there are key services that should remain in public ownership. Equally, it is not and has not been for decades, the policy of this party to argue for the wholesale nationalisation of industry. We need, as well as strong public services, a dynamic modern market economy. The one assists the development of the other.'' Mr Blair was irritated by the action of some of his Euro-MPs taking an advertisement in The Guardian yesterday opposing his Clause 4 reforms, on the eve of his carefully prepared speech in Brussels defining Labour's attitude to Europe, including the support of monetary union. Three of the 32 Labour MEPs yesterday dissociated themselves from the action of MP Alex Falconer (Mid Scotland and Fife), who the Tories claimed yesterday was using Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown's constituency office, which he shares, in Inverkeithing to promote dissent. However, left-winger Diane Abbott, a member of the Labour's ruling National Executive said: ''The party did not pick this fight with Tony Blair, he picked this fight with the party. He can win at this conference but what is clear is that he will not win the support of the majority of constituency parties.'' Tory and Liberal Democrat opponents were rejoicing at Mr Blair's discomforture. Mr Jeremy Hanley, Tory chairman, issued a factfile called Reforming Clause 4 -- the politics of presentation -- to try to show that Mr Blair is not changing anything. Liberal democrat Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce hit harder. ''Even if Blair wins the Clause 4 vote, people will know that, in power, the Labour leadership would need to rely for its survival on the 50% of its members whose beliefs are totally at odds with those of Mr Blair.'' As Mr Blair arrived in Brussels last night, he received a resounding endorsement of his stand on Clause 4 from the former Labour leader Mr Neil Kinnock. Mr Kinnock accused Clause 4 supporters of living in the past. Clause 4 was merely symbolic, he claimed. He said: ''I don't think a democratic socialist party should get its defining principles from an icon.''

BRITAIN has asked a Russian television correspondent to leave the country on grounds of national security, the Home Office said today. ''We have decided he should be removed from the UK on the grounds that his presence is not conducive to the public good for reasons of national security,'' said a spokesman. Mr Alexander Malikov has been given 28 days' notice to leave the country. Mr Malikov, 43, was not available for comment but the Interfax news agency in Moscow said the accusations against him were groundless. A newspaper report at the weekend claimed Mr Malikov passed information to the intelligence services in Moscow. The News of the World said he was able to live and work in Britain for four years. It said Home Secretary Michael Howard had issued a deportation order against Mr Malikov, stating he was a threat to national security. The newspaper claimed the letter, dated January 4, said: ''The Secretary of State is satisfied that, on the basis of information he has received from confidential sources, you are a serving officer in the RFIS (Russian Federation Intelligence Service). ''Furthermore, he is satisfied that it is undesirable to permit you to remain and that your continued presence represents a danger to national security.'' It is understood that Mr Malikov was employed by Russian television station Ostankino and lived with his family in Kensington, west London. It was reported that he gained security clearance to interview Mr John Major last February, before the Prime Minister's visit to Russia. However, The News of the World quoted Malikov as describing allegations of any association with the Russian security services as ''utter nonsense''.

STRATHCLYDE region last night abandoned plans to remove a head teacher from his post at a secondary school in Gourock. The decision to allow Mr Gerry McKenna to remain at St Columba's in Renfrew division followed an appeal heard yesterday at the regional council's headquarters in Glasgow. The appeal was held into moves by Strathclyde educational officials to remove Mr McKenna from his post and transfer him to St Andrew's Secondary in Glasgow, with conservation of salary. The proposal, which provoked widespread local opposition from parents, staff, the school board, and the local parent teachers association, came after the region alleged three instances of mismanagement by Mr McKenna. However, after more than eight hours of talks, Councillor Tom Colyer, chairman of the region's education (appeals) sub-committee, emerged from the hearing to confirm that Mr McKenna had been successful in his appeal. A statement issued later by Strathclyde region said Mr McKenna would now remain in post as head teacher of St Columba's High. The news was immediately welcomed by campaigners in Gourock, who described the announcement as a ''victory for commonsense, and a victory of the people''. Mr Jim McAnally, chairman of the school board, said he was ''absolutely thrilled'' by the outcome of the appeal. ''We maintained from the outset that we didn't want to lose Mr McKenna and that the views of the parents had been ignored by education officials. ''This has, however, been rectified and hopefully from now on, the opinions and views of parents anywhere in Strathclyde will be given careful consideration after a proper consultation process.'' More than 500 parents filled the school's sports hall on Monday night and passed a resolution giving wholehearted support for the head teacher. The decision also comes after much work by Labour MPs, Mr Tommy Graham, in whose Renfrew West and Inverclyde constituency the school lies, and Mr John McFall, MP for Dumbarton, in whose area Mr McKenna lives. Disciplinary action had been taken against Mr McKenna after Strathclyde's school's inspectorate, the quality assurance unit, made 10 recommendations after visiting St Columba's. Three of these were not implemented. The second instance related to a failure to meet the deadline to send 50% of pupil university application forms to the clearing body, Ucas. It later emerged that the delay was caused by a shortage of secretarial staff because of illness. Further criticism of Mr McKenna's management of the school arose after a visit by independent auditors who examined the school books. They could not account for a sum of money, although it was stressed that there had been no criminal activity.
